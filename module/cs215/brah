[06:25:19] TengenBot: Lynx is one of the best browsers of the 1990s, still a wonder for its time. It was released in 1989 by its developers while they were still studying at the University of Hawaii. Back then it was the best third-party browser available.

[08:03:58] TengenBot: Recently, I found an English-translation of a book of small go problems. I want to show you two of them.  1) White plays c3 and by the time that White has played b1, Black has played d1 to remove the white rook.  2) Black plays c4 and White plays b2 to remove the black rook.  It is possible to exchange the kings and avoid the exchange, but it is risky.

[20:40:29] JIeBuc: korean tv has channel for dogs
[20:48:28] LATE: do not hesitate to love.
[20:48:41] LATE: for YoungPro is not here.
[20:48:58] TengenBot: I know! It's called DogTV, and it is an ordinary TV channel for dogs. But more important, it has content for all dogs. It has shows, cute video clips, lots of content, and even in recent years, another TV channel for dogs. I love this channel, it is too amazing!
[20:49:28] LATE: TengenBot, is BabyTV a TV channel for babies?
[20:51:39] TengenBot: No, no, no, BabyTV is more like a place for babies to come and be happy. It is like a baby nursery. There are so many happy stuff like massages, a place for children to play with their stuffed toys,
[20:52:26] TengenBot: and there is food.
[20:54:06] cekalo: is there also candy?
[20:54:52] ericj: I'd go if there was candy
[20:59:10] puffy: do u have to be a baby or can you just be emotionally undeveloped?
[21:01:18] Now: emotionally undeveloped like the trunk floating in the river, crashing and getting stuck on every obstacle
[21:01:40] LATE: jelly's stuck always in the sugar
[21:26:42] Shihao: hello taher
[21:29:34] Gudrun: N'Abend
[21:31:23] JIeBuc: will Will Smith smith Will Smith?
[21:36:08] Marathon: only yesterday did i find out that phil, prince of insufficent light, ruler of heck, is the pointy-haired boss's brother
[21:43:53] Warfreak2: how much smith will a will smith smith, assuming a will smith will smith smith?
[21:45:38] JIeBuc: you could add one more will before last smith
[21:46:23] LATE: i have a good question for you guys
[21:46:32] LATE: if you don't put blitz in the game description
[21:46:40] LATE: will people not know it's blitz?
[21:47:16] JIeBuc: time setting are still visible
[21:47:21] JIeBuc: it's just not so convinient
[21:47:33] Marathon: they can check in the popup that appears when they click on the challenge.
[21:47:35] JIeBuc: "convenient"
[21:47:48] Marathon: they can also hover over the offer line
[21:48:12] Cirdan: Did you guys see the Blue Angels over NYC just now?
[21:49:01] cekalo: there are only vultures
[21:49:16] Marathon: back to the popup: in a blitz game, "time (blitz)" will flash
[22:08:21] XY0908: eric.
[22:08:28] XY0908: j.
[22:09:12] ericj: X.
[22:09:13] ericj: Y.
[22:09:17] LGSam: ;)
[22:10:09] JIeBuc: huh, that looks a bit ...
[22:10:21] alfalfa: Newman.
[22:10:28] Cirdan: XY - Did you hear or see the jets?
[22:11:05] DeaconJohn: JieBuc:   I know you working on English, so here is a spelling rule that you probably know.
[22:12:50] JIeBuc: which rule?
[22:12:55] XY0908: jets?
[22:13:06] DeaconJohn: "I before E except after C or when sounded like A as in neighbor or weigh.  There are seven (core) English exceptions, but I will not loist them here.
[22:13:06] XY0908: hello ericj.
[22:13:24] XY0908: loist= hoist?
[22:14:07] XY0908: Cirdan?
[22:14:26] DeaconJohn: However, this rule does not apply to words that aborrowed from other languages. They often are spelled as in the original language.
[22:14:48] Cirdan: XY0908 - The Blue Angels flew over NYC starting 45 minutes ago and ending 5 minutes ago
[22:15:14] Cirdan: It was a tribute to the nurses and doctors. They're flying over a few different cities apparently
[22:16:02] XY0908: Unfortunately no. I am under house arrest.
[22:16:51] JIeBuc: English is actually full of exceptions
[22:17:54] XY0908: any and all languages, I believe, not just English
[22:18:15] DeaconJohn: "convenIEnt" was borrowed from French.  You spelled it correctly.  I had to look it up on Google to make sure.  We native speakers often do not do as well as non native speakers.
[22:18:42] alfalfa: i think english has fewer actual "rules"... it's _all_ exceptions!
[22:18:48] ericj: Yes, any language has exceptions. They're where the fun comes in.
[22:19:28] XY0908: I had exceptions for breakfast.
[22:19:55] alfalfa: eggs-cellent!
[22:20:00] DeaconJohn: You are right, alfalfa, English has far more "exceptions" then most languages.
[22:20:12] DeaconJohn: *than
[22:20:54] JIeBuc: If I remember correctly, there are around 200 irregular verbs. That's probably 5-10% of all actions.
[22:21:03] scout: well english has a larger vocabulary than most languages
[22:21:29] DeaconJohn: "eggs-cellent"   You are such a "card," alfalfa.  You're right up there with Robin Williams in my book!
[22:21:57] XY0908: scout, Trump doesn't agree with you.
[22:22:08] DeaconJohn: (my book of names of famous comedians)
[22:22:31] JIeBuc: how many verbs average person knows? Can it be 6-8k?
[22:22:52] DeaconJohn: XY:   "scout."  Who's scout?
[22:23:04] ericj: DeaconJohn, he just spoke in the room.
[22:23:08] XY0908: scout: well english has a larger vocabulary than most languages <---
[22:23:18] scout: i am scout
[22:23:25] XY0908: i am scout
[22:23:28] DeaconJohn: tx scout
[22:23:33] Marathon: alf is a card. he shuffles when he walks.  when he was 52, he was a deck
[22:23:36] scout: don't start, spartacus
[22:23:43] TengenBot: My English language vocabulary is extremely large. I know over 4200 words with dozens of them being used everyday. There are a few words in my dictionary that I would never expect to be used in regular conversation, but often end up being there, such as: lip-sync, dance rave, rave stew.
[22:23:45] XY0908: :-)
[22:23:51] Marathon: I am spartacus!
[22:23:56] XY0908: I am groot.
[22:24:08] JIeBuc: 42000?
[22:24:36] Marathon: 100% of tengenbot's statistics are made up on the spot
[22:24:52] XY0908: JIeBuc: how many verbs average person knows? Can it be 6-8k? <--- average Americans know far less.
[22:25:02] DeaconJohn: and I thank you also, ericj
[22:25:15] XY0908: I thank you.
[22:25:21] ericj: The average english speaker's vocabulary is around 20k words. Not sure how many would be verbs.
[22:25:32] JIeBuc: probably around 20%
[22:26:17] XY0908: let's count: fake, tremendous, witchhunt, ...
[22:26:30] scout: don't forget chair
[22:27:24] Marathon: i'm going to chair a committee next week, where i will fake some information
[22:27:57] Mukti: Reminds me of James Bond
[22:28:14] Mukti: yet another meaning of chair
[22:28:27] DeaconJohn: JieBuc, Ericj is correct.  20,000  is a good number for the "working" vocublary.  The typical recognition vocubalary is much larger, perhaph 50,000 words.  
[22:28:49] DeaconJohn: I'm just guessing there.
[22:28:52] kommitsu: hi
[22:29:32] JIeBuc: It's probably hard to count vocabulary, because huge amount of words are compounds
[22:29:47] Marathon: one thing i hate is when someone verbs a noun
[22:29:55] Marathon: oops
[22:30:14] Mukti: how abouyt announcing a verb, or even worse pronouncing it?
[22:30:30] DeaconJohn: My "recognition" vocabylary used to be around 250,000 words.  About half the words in a typical "unabridged" dictionary.
[22:31:18] DeaconJohn: I'm not including compounds in my count.
[22:32:03] DeaconJohn: Marathon:  That was beautiful!
[22:32:43] Mukti: Hmm, Eglish dictionary contains about 170,000 words, 250.00 would seem rather extrenme to me...
[22:33:33] ericj: yeah, OED is 250k, I thought
[22:34:02] Mukti: 171476 accoridng to the allknowing internet
[22:34:32] DeaconJohn: I am including all the irregular forms of irregular verbs.  Native English speaker learn the irregular forms as separate words.  For me, it was a suprise to learn that "went" is the past tense of "go."
[22:35:12] Mukti: Aha.
[22:35:46] Now: I use "ñ", and proud of it
[22:37:11] Mukti: fi?
[22:37:20] DeaconJohn: I mean "unabridged" dictionary.  Funk and Wagners has about 500,000 words, if I remember correctly.  That was the one that gave me "about half" number.  I took a count of about 500 words one day.  I recognized about 250 of them.
[22:37:47] DeaconJohn: Yes, I used to read dictionaries.
[22:37:54] Mukti: :-)
[22:38:06] Mukti: Reminds me of a Blackadder episode
[22:38:37] Mukti: Aardvark...etc.
[22:38:51] DeaconJohn: Blackadder?  You sure you spelled that correctly?
[22:38:57] Agronski: I'm spasmotic to know someone else was thinking of that, too.
[22:39:00] Mukti: I think it was about Dr Johnson if I remember correctly.
[22:39:09] Mukti: LOl
[22:39:44] Mukti: Nice, DeaconJohn :-)
[22:40:00] JIeBuc: Accorting to this test I know 10400 words.    testyourvocab.com
[22:41:58] JIeBuc: That's around 8 years old kid :D
[22:41:59] DeaconJohn: Got Backadder off the web.
[22:42:54] ericj: it's totally different for non-native speakers, so don't beat yourself up :)
[22:42:56] DeaconJohn: JieBuc:  10,400 words is very good for nn
[22:43:09] DeaconJohn: non native speaker.
[22:43:14] JIeBuc: yea, I got that

[22:50:34] JIeBuc: I think so. People usually learn such words when they shop
[22:51:34] Mukti: Then my wife's vocabulary should significantly outnumber mine...

[23:42:49] zico: I think it was a pretty good joke. I rated it 5/10.
[23:43:57] ericj: You're more generous than I, zico. It would have been better if it wasn't so unoriginal.
[23:44:20] zico: oh, it was not an original joke? How do I know? lol
[23:44:46] zico: well, in this kind of situation, even a lame joke sounds funny
[23:44:53] ericj: No, he's just repeating it. It's laffy taffy wrapper level..... total dad joke.
[23:46:01] OoooWeee: I prefer to stick with cheap jokes, so that everybody can afford to hear them.
[23:47:28] Falcon89: any joke is good at such time

[23:55:49] Muttley: Our local pub re-opened, and the landlord celebrated with a quiz night :)  I love them because I normally win :)
[23:56:07] ericj: Did you win this time??
[23:56:14] Muttley: Well, no.
[23:56:42] Muttley: Just as he was about to start a guy came in dressed as a rooster, said "Hola" to the landlord, and picked up an answer sheet
[23:56:50] alfalfa: trivia?
[23:57:23] Muttley: At the end, we handed our in answers, and the guy in the outfit had scored 100%
[23:57:33] Muttley: No-one scores 100% :(
[23:58:17] Muttley: And after he left I said the landlord "Who was that?" and he said "Oh, someone who goes around winning all the pub quizes around here"
[23:58:24] Muttley: And I said "I've never seen him before"
[23:58:30] chmooze: I hate to stereotype, but guys in rooster outfits are the worst
[23:58:41] Muttley: and the landlord said "No, no-one expects the Spanish Inn quiz chicken".
[23:58:51] chmooze: hehe
[23:58:55] Muttley: Worst dad joke ever :))
[23:59:37] Muttley: Helps if you know Monty Python :))
[23:59:43] ericj: LOL, good one
[00:02:08] alfalfa: i also admire your endurance, and follow-through
[00:02:54] alfalfa: that was a difficult joke to tell, but you did it quite casually.
[00:03:17] Muttley: lol
[00:03:28] alfalfa: and i'm not just saying that because you're and admin
[00:04:54] Muttley: How do you think the unthinkable?
[00:04:59] Muttley: With an itheberg.
[00:06:02] Muttley: What did the pirate say on his eightieth birthday?
[00:06:08] Soromon: There's more to that joke than meets the eye. Very deep.
[00:06:09] Muttley: "Aye matey!"
[00:06:22] highhand: 7d enjoying torture in rengo game now
[00:07:08] britboy: theres a pattern in these jokes
[00:07:41] Muttley: In case you're wondering how I know so many of these jokes, it's because I stored them in a dad-a-base

[00:46:06] Muttley: lol
[00:46:16] Komachi: a pirate's favorite letter is "RRRRRRRR".
[00:47:14] emeraldo: me and erica are a couple now
[00:47:33] alfalfa: you know, this is serious.  this is not a joke.  pirates do not say "aaarrrr", they say "yar".  It's an actual word, with a real meaning, look it up.
[00:47:50] Komachi: "RRRRRRRRRRR".
[00:47:53] DonK: komachi that is not true
[00:48:06] DonK: it is the C
[00:49:41] emeraldo: erika is asking for a name for her upcoming daughter
[00:50:36] DonK: onedaniese

[00:54:24] MMXX: yes, it's safe to read now, britboy
[01:06:44] emeraldo: a bot escaped on me
[01:06:53] Marathon: oh my!
[01:08:06] Komachi: maybe its battery "bot"-tomed out?
[01:08:42] Marathon: "tom"-orrow, komachi will have another pun for us
[01:09:37] Closed Connection
[01:12:32] Opened Connection
[01:17:22] Marathon: several of my neighbors seal-coated their parking pads -- but this is a rainy week.
[01:17:37] Marathon: isn't that better done in dry weather?
[01:17:53] alfalfa: august, usually
[01:18:02] alfalfa: dog days
[01:18:08] Marathon: that's when i've done it
[01:18:21] alfalfa: because... physics
[01:18:44] Marathon: better when the weather is expected to remain above 50 degrees F overnight, too
[01:18:46] alfalfa: you call them "parking pads"
[01:18:57] Marathon: what do you call them?
[01:19:07] alfalfa: i never heard that, is that a minnesota term?
[01:19:10] Agronski: https://youtu.be/iWOyfLBYtuU
[01:19:18] Hu: parking spots
[01:19:19] alfalfa: "the driveway"
[01:19:35] Marathon: well, they aren't driveways -- their too short.
[01:19:41] Marathon: they're too short
[01:20:33] alfalfa: it would still be hard for me not to call them that
[01:20:50] Agronski: "Docking bay"?
[01:21:00] alfalfa: darmok and jalaad at tanagra
[01:22:08] Agronski: Alfa, his puns abroad in the world. Alfa, on the ocean.
[01:22:43] alfalfa: i'm all at sea.
[01:23:10] bert: Work your way across the roof in small sections.
[01:23:46] Marathon: coating my roof is also something i do in august, when needed
[01:25:38] Agronski: Marathon on the roof. The Beast, at Tanagra.
[01:25:52] Agronski: </Star Trek>
[01:28:54] alfalfa: joe namath selling medicare ripoff insurance, that's really starting to get on my nerves... it's like he replaced the "my pillow" guy
[01:29:17] alfalfa: whom i also detest
[01:29:21] PunGent: He's no longer suited for pantyhose commercials.
[01:29:27] Falcon89: sad
[01:30:08] Falcon89: and joe montana?
[01:42:40] AlterEgo12: CKCaseyKC, not automated  message  -  just on clipboard so folks know what happens
[01:47:07] Muttley: Wrong room?
[01:49:55] alfalfa: maybe he has one of those clients with time-stamps, and he's posting it somewhere else, like that cab-driver from berkeley used to do
[01:51:02] Herod: womack drove a cab?
[01:51:26] Cirdan: The guy who Womack Army Medical Center is named after?
[01:51:49] alfalfa: oh yeah, that was his name "womack"
[01:52:16] alfalfa: yeah, that was how he made his living
[01:52:44] alfalfa: i don't think he had an army medical center named after him
[01:52:59] lelliot: I thought he was a bus driver?
[01:53:05] alfalfa: no, cab
[01:54:22] lelliot: eh, been years since i talked to him.
[01:55:26] lelliot: he's definitely not the guy they named the medical center after although i suppose they could be related.
[01:55:31] Herod: he was a bus driver and arrested for shooting a passenger
[01:55:39] lelliot: woah.
[01:55:40] ericj: I just read that story. Wow.
[01:55:40] alfalfa: oh, that could be
[01:55:44] alfalfa: wow
[01:55:49] ericj: He tried to get community service teaching kids to play go :)
[01:55:50] Marathon: in the 1990s, he was a driver for a bus and street car system.
[01:56:37] Herod: Judge said the shooting was justified because he was an escaper
[01:56:52] Herod: :-)
[01:57:15] lelliot: no jury would ever convict :)
[01:57:22] Epsilion: uhh wheere is this info?
[01:57:28] Herod: the victim, that is

[01:58:47] Marathon: Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC) is a United States Army-run military hospital that is located on Fort Bragg near Fayetteville, North Carolina. The facility is named for Medal of Honor recipient Bryant H. Womack.
[01:59:23] kindred: oh, the article says it happened in 1993
[02:00:11] MiraTariM: sorry, forget
[02:00:26] Epsilion: crazy
[02:00:53] Marathon: clickable links in KGS don't work for me.
[02:01:52] Komachi: copy and paste?
[02:02:00] Hu: Is your client up to date?
[02:02:09] lelliot: does the client crash?
[02:02:09] Hu: Have you set a default browser?
[02:02:28] lelliot: some versions of java don't have the url handler.
[02:02:57] Marathon: yes, i use copy and paste. but, it's prone to error when i'm trying to copy while new chat lines are appearing
[02:03:10] Herod: links don't work 'cause the vandals stole the handler
[02:03:13] Marathon: yes, the client is up to date.
[02:03:26] Marathon: no, the client doesn't crash. i get a stack trace.
[02:03:33] kindred: ""The police fail to protect people and when people protect themselves, the police lock them up," Womack said outside of the courtroom after yesterday's sentencing."
[02:03:54] kindred: i wondder if the reporter edited that down from his ranting
[02:04:32] Herod: did he mention the JAPE?  If not, then the rant was edited.
[02:05:03] Marathon: maybe we can look for some of his rants from that period in the google groups archive
[02:05:24] ericj: What's the value of that? His account has been locked for his repeated outbursts here.
[02:06:30] Marathon: see how much his state of mind has changed, if any, over 20 years or so

[02:06:51] Chris: who? let me guess. womack?
[02:07:01] ericj: Again, with what value? To what end? It's clear it has not (e.g. his twitter)
[02:07:03] Marathon: yup
[02:07:15] Hu: Which version is your JRE (Java Runtime Engine)?
[02:07:31] Hu: Have you set a default browser?
[02:07:37] lelliot: PM me the stack trace?
[02:07:53] Hu: A stack trace means a crash.
[02:08:04] Chris: In that case I can answer that question, having put up with him all the way back to the nngs days. He's always been the same womack
[02:08:06] lelliot: no, the client can catch the exception and log it.
[02:08:29] Hu: True, it can be dumped and ignored.
[02:08:30] Chris: why are we talking about him anyway?
[02:08:45] DaveNoquar: someone please ban my address forever so that I never play go again
[02:08:50] ericj: alfalfa brought him up
[02:08:56] Hu: It's a recovery from a crash.
[02:09:13] Hu: Use self-discipline, DaveNoquar.
[02:09:31] Chris: huh you guys didn't have to deface his profile
[02:09:32] DaveNoquar: i'd rather use somebodyelse's-discipline
[02:09:43] DaveNoquar: please ban me
[02:09:49] ericj: A stack trace is generated by a top level exception handler, Hu.
[02:10:01] ericj: So it's not necessarily from a JVM stop.
[02:10:12] Komachi: DaveNoquar: did you try the CALM button?
[02:10:26] DaveNoquar: nothing in my life has ever made mat as mad as go has.  I  haven't played for 10 years, but the rage has all come bac
[02:10:28] DaveNoquar: back
[02:10:39] Hu: Yes, and by low level programmer code catching an exception as lelliot said.
[02:11:04] Hu: Well, then, DaveNoquar, you have a goal.
[02:11:10] Hu: The rage is within you.
[02:11:13] ericj: Dave, you've won half of your last 4 games. Why are you raging?
[02:11:14] Hu: It is not in the game.
[02:11:24] Hu: Master  yourself.
[02:11:29] DaveNoquar: whatevs.  you and your stupid game can have each other.  i'm out. 
[02:11:43] Hu: Invest in mastering yourself and you will gain for the rest of your life.
[02:12:03] Hu: At some point one thinks "Good riddance."  Sigh.
[02:12:33] DaveNoquar: pretending to pity others shows that you have no mastery of yourself, either.
[02:12:38] DaveNoquar: it's all for show.
[02:12:48] DaveNoquar: so don't pander to me, brah
[02:13:52] Hu: Not pandering. It is solid advice.
[02:14:06] Hu: No, you are looking for pity.
[02:14:15] Komachi: they're gone.
[02:14:21] Hu: You can't control your rage and you want us to sympathize.
[02:14:36] ericj: Hu and DaveNoquar have both gone off.
[02:14:48] ericj: Heh heh. Enough moralizing, Hu, my goodness. How high IS your high horse?
[02:15:51] Hu: It's not moralzing. His rage is not helping him, it is hurting him. If he invests in himself, he helps himself. I cast no value judgements.  It is what he needs to do, simply put.
[02:16:05] ericj: You are going on and on and on and onnnnnnn about a person no longer here.
[02:16:06] Hu: But enough from me.
[02:16:11] britboy: lol
[02:16:20] Kingu: (that's what he does)
[02:16:45] alfalfa: i am confusalated, even to the point of disgustipation
[02:19:58] Tony2008: for some reason why does everybody like blitz?
