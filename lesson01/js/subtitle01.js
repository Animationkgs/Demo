1 - Welcome - lang_en_vs1.srt
1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome to statistics,
the science of decisions.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,762
But before we get started with
the class Sean, Katie, and

3
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:11,020
I want to talk to you a little bit about
what our expectations are for you and

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,820
what you should expect
to learn in the class.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,420
&gt;&gt; As you know,
this is an online course and

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,770
online courses differ greatly
from in-class courses.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,420
First, you will not be coming to
a classroom two to three times a week.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,100
Instead, you'll be working from home or
wherever.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,040
Whether it's on a mobile device,
a tablet or a PC.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,942
One thing that you should notice is
that this is a self-paced course.

11
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:37,100
That means, you are responsible for
deciding when and

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,200
where you complete the material.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,500
&gt;&gt; Because this is online and
this is self-paced,

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,210
a lot of the responsibility
falls on you.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,100
You need to find the motivation
to come to class,

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,530
and, by class, I mean going to
the online course every day.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,310
It's important that you distribute
your learning over time.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,470
Online courses,
it's easy to fall away and

19
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,200
forget about them because you're
not driving to a campus every day.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,410
So you have to remember to check in and
time manage, in a way, so

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,780
that you are learning a little
bit about statistics every day.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,430
That will make the learning better and

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,140
that will make the course
a lot more enjoyable.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,420
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is important for

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,150
you guys to take responsibility, but the
main objective is for you guys to learn.

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,930
And, yes, you're going to struggle
sometimes, but that's the whole point.

27
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,220
At Udacity, we want to give you
a quiz to make you struggle first, so

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,060
that you form your own ideas about this
concept before we start teaching you

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,800
the formalized statistical
way of learning it.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,960
&gt;&gt; I would also encourage you to
take advantage of your classmates.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,650
There's a lot of knowledge out there and

32
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,280
there's a lot of knowledge about
statistics already, so use each other.

2 - Intro --write-auto-sub
welcome to elementary statistics we're
really excited to have you on board
my name is Katie and I'm the one who
will be explaining most of the concepts
throughout this course also be doing a
lot of drawing and a lot of writing to
help you understand the content as much
as possible in each of the 16 lessons in
this course you'll learn new methods to
describe and analyze data each lesson
builds on the concepts you learned
before so as you progress through the
course try to get a good grasp of the
material before moving on but if it
turns out you need a review no big deal
you can easily go back and re-watch the
videos and redo the exercises what do I
mean by exercises each lesson consists
of short instructional videos where I
explain cool stat stuff and guide your
thinking but we want you to make
breakthroughs on your own so instead of
just telling you a factor formula we'll
ask a quiz a quiz or exercise same thing
is not there for us to judge you or to
impact your grade it's there for your
own benefit to make you think at udacity
we believe that the chance to think
about something from your own unique
perspective is a powerful learning
opportunity

3 - MnMs - lang_en_vs2.srt
1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,680
For example, let's say you have a jar of M&amp;Ms. If

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,700
you reached in and randomly grabbed one, what color do you think

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,960
it would most likely be? Red, blue, green, orange, or yellow?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,390
Click the radio button that corresponds to the answer you would choose.

4 - MnMs Solution - lang_en_vs4.srt
1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,200
Well, our best guess would be blue, since most

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,510
of the M and M's are blue. See? A lot

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,120
of statistics is just about using your intuition. In this

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,160
course, you'll build on the intuition that you already have.

5 - Definitely blue - lang_en_vs2.srt
1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,290
Quizzes won't always be multiple choice, like this one. For example,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,670
let's ask another question. If you reach your hand in this jar

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,400
of M&amp;Ms and randomly grab one, just like in the last

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,930
quiz, will it definitely be blue? This time, type yes or no.
