[22:59:03] bert: i only encountered it twice lately
[23:00:33] puffy: admins keep tripping over the cord
[23:00:46] bert: which is still too often, sure, but not that bad
[23:02:01] Eliza: do not!
[23:02:25] Eliza: keep  admins away from the cords
[23:03:25] Marathon: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0815/7955/products/8x10-doomulusprime.png?v=1557891537
[23:05:42] ericj: I don't even know if that joke was funny the first 5 times it was told, puffy
[23:12:41] cronin: Don't hate the puffer, hate the game
[23:28:31] Agronski: Safe valuable effort: hate both.
[00:11:26] DOW23944: 9d game
[00:14:33] AmyTS: warble
[00:15:07] Agronski: Won't the mask muffle that slightly?
[00:16:01] AmyTS: slightly
[00:16:40] Agronski: The price we pay, I suppose.
[00:16:43] PunGent: So, is a warble larger or smaller than a virus?
[00:18:43] arndt: it encompasses and enfolds it
[00:19:35] PunGent: So ... it's like a viral diaper?
[00:38:41] Tedlin1: hi Rich
[00:39:31] MARG0: Hello!
[00:48:17] Khalir: Hi guys, how could i find a stronger player to review my games ? or help weaker players myself
[00:49:28] UTDEspy: The KGS Teaching Ladder under Lessons rooms is a good place to start
[00:49:53] UTDEspy: It helps when asking for a review if you say what rank you are, and what rank your opponent was if it's a specific game, so we can be lazy and not try to find you in the usuers list
[00:50:29] PunGent: Or the you-sewers list.
[00:51:30] AmyTS: i respect people to sew themselves together.
[00:52:30] Thorongil: See also "A stitch in time saves nine"
[00:52:59] PunGent: Why does nine need to be saved?  It's a perfectly safe number, already?
[00:53:02] Khalir: ty utd:)
[00:53:42] Cedric1978: nine for the nine human kings
[00:54:18] Karnaj: nine rings
[00:54:18] Thorongil: who then became the 9 ringwraiths, yes
[00:54:28] DOW23944: 9 isn't safe at all
[00:54:33] DOW23944: 7 ... ate nine
[00:54:35] Thorongil: Coprrect
[00:54:40] Thorongil: correct
[00:54:53] Thorongil: 9 is a VERY dangerous number
[00:55:34] Thorongil: It chills my very bones to think of it
[00:56:16] bert: it is on unesco list of endangered numbers
[00:56:46] Thorongil: So is my bank balance
[00:56:59] Thorongil: Thanks coronavirus
[01:04:11] Now: I can´t stop winning games
[01:05:15] cekalo: i can stop you if you want
[01:05:32] altstar: I can help too
[01:06:36] Now: nice answer guys, just wanted to spread some positive energy
[01:06:51] UTDEspy: Haha
[01:07:29] triangle2: gross, what is positive energy doing in EGR ?
[01:08:11] Agronski: Waiting for the antimatter annihilation event, clearly.
[01:14:59] bert: xcept it doesn't matter
[01:16:32] Agronski: (to the tune of Bohemian Rhapsody) ♫ "Nothing's really matter, energy is 'c'..."♫
[01:17:13] bert: i c
[01:21:45] triangle2: how is the correct pronunciation of Golois ? Will someone who speaks Franche please explain
[01:22:56] JIeBuc: how rubic's cube was made and how people find out how to solve it?
[01:23:09] Agronski: Gal-wah-zz
[01:23:25] triangle2: JleBuc: it was invented by a hungarian mad scientist named Erno Rubik
[01:23:57] Epsilion: these mad scientists have curious ways of entertaining themselves
[01:23:58] triangle2: after he invented it he spent several months trying to devise a way to solve it and then came up with one
[01:24:37] JIeBuc: I see, thx for that
[01:24:54] JIeBuc: That definitely wasn't an easy task
[01:25:17] bert: yes, it may be hard to make money wih a puzzle you can't solve
[01:25:47] legato: WHO WANTS TO PLAY ME I'M 9K
[01:25:50] legato: oops caps
[01:25:52] legato: lol
[01:26:03] JIeBuc: first layers are rather simple, people can find solutions rather fast
[01:26:12] LinuxGooo: legato, you wanna ?
[01:26:14] UTDEspy: Imagining you kicking open the door to the room, demanding a game
[01:26:15] JIeBuc: but last pieces
[01:26:20] legato: yes linux
[01:26:27] LinuxGooo: open a board pls
[01:26:28] legato: i'll make a game here
[01:26:29] triangle2: the way for solving a cube layer by layer has become obsolete, for beginners only now
[01:26:33] LinuxGooo: fine ....
[01:26:41] LinuxGooo: little bit rusty ... :-) hehe ...
