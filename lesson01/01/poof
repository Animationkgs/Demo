[07:39:30] Herod: most of the people here know more than you think they do
[07:39:42] zerocool: I'm no better for facts than the tourist who happened to snap a picture
[07:41:12] zerocool: I am at ground zero, and I see the chaos, but my expertiese is networking, not medical stuffs, but the stuff even I see knowing nothing *eyeroll*
[07:45:37] zerocool: there are a lot of anxios college students wanting to be a part of something BIG, I'm in the ER, I'm in the ICU, I remember being young and excited, but yea, there is something wrong about that
[08:00:44] TengenBot: Now on store shelves everywhere: TengenBot souveniers! This set includes a number of TengenBots (not Tengen Monsters, which are very different, and I don't know why) plus a ridiculously useful (and easy to use!) store centipede that comes with six common tools! Now you can easily store, move, and reinforce your tools all at the same time!
[08:07:27] LinuxGooo: wish you all a good night. On the way to take a nap. See you guys. :-)

[10:18:08] MagicMike: 7k game?
[10:26:08] HK14k: no thx, you escape

[10:55:59] flow: then there is no other player
[10:56:51] BoPeep: you must track him down and anihilate him
[10:57:11] BoPeep: he's committed an act of treason
[11:09:23] Ryukai: How's this free KGS+ thing work?
[11:52:19] hpsamsam: gofan's RENGO , one slot left.
[12:18:38] ApplePie: hello everyone
[12:19:13] ApplePie: and you are watching ....
[12:19:15] ApplePie: Disney channel
[12:21:14] meyerX: i want applepie

[12:24:41] ApplePie: they ran out of pies in costco
[12:24:46] ApplePie: my heart is broken
[12:24:52] meyerX: let's go to walmart
[12:25:02] ApplePie: do they sell pies in walmart?
[12:25:08] meyerX: maybe
[12:25:12] meyerX: you have to find out
[12:25:13] ApplePie: ok
[12:26:23] meyerX: have you downloaded their app?
[12:26:42] ApplePie: no I haven't
[12:26:48] ApplePie: I probably should
[12:27:08] ApplePie: I usually just go to costco, food4less and 99 ranch
[12:27:53] ApplePie: because I can only afford cheap groceries
[12:27:57] ApplePie: and I love asian food
[12:28:40] meyerX: i love sushi and ramen
[12:28:51] ApplePie: Nice
[12:28:54] ApplePie: me too
[12:29:11] meyerX: but my local walmart stops providing them
[12:29:13] meyerX: i'm mad
[12:29:30] ApplePie: dang
[12:30:29] ApplePie: try some other supermarkets
[12:31:53] meyerX: and my favourite sushi restaurant in town does not  offer takeaway
[12:31:59] meyerX: i'm mad *2
[12:33:10] ApplePie: are they still open??
[12:33:17] meyerX: yup
[12:33:23] ApplePie: wow
[12:33:33] ApplePie: you can just dine in then
[12:33:42] meyerX: i don't want to go out
[12:33:49] ApplePie: lol
[14:27:31] cronin: Good morning
[14:35:49] bert: moroning, yes
[14:38:56] cronin: Wow, sorry but too early to be edgy for me

[17:42:38] highhand: harukunn has game in pandorarengo room, need 2
[17:42:59] highhand: rengo game is a 4 person game, not everyone knows this
[17:50:56] Chris: that is factually incorrect. rengo is a 3 person game of waiting for a fourth
[17:51:09] Kingu: lol
[17:53:19] cronin: XD
[17:53:33] domie: lol
[18:05:15] Kingu: aka “the Beckett game”
[18:06:16] MrPanda: anything interesting going on ?
[18:06:30] Kingu: a mortal disease
[18:08:13] MrPanda: lol
[18:33:28] XY0908: Good morning.
[18:33:43] ummjhall: good evening
[18:33:45] XY0908: What's GoUniverse please?
[18:36:19] XY0908: Ok, I have more interesting question: Is English Muffin actually originated from England? Or is it used as French in French Fries?
[18:38:38] cronin: Hi
[18:39:31] cronin: GoUniverse is the awesome chrome extension that offers a client to kgs
[18:39:41] cronin: Written by kocmohabt
[18:39:58] Agronski: Think "English Muffin" is used to distinguish them from US "muffins" which are more like cupcakes. Whether or not they originate from England isn't really important.
[18:41:49] XY0908: Thanks both. Agronski, hope you are not acting like a teacher I had when I was in elementary school, sixty years ago.
[18:42:37] rarara: The Lyre bird pretends to be other birds and can imitate their singing.
[18:47:23] Agronski: Acting how?
[18:50:28] XY0908: there was a teacher, an old man, who would say "It's not important." when we, 7 year old children, asked questions and he didn't know the answers.
[18:51:10] XY0908: You know, 7 years could have many unexpected questions.
[18:52:15] Chris: that's at least better than making stuff up like we should inject ourselves with lysol to prevent covid
[18:52:18] XY0908: full of wonderful ideas and totally curious about everything.
[18:52:32] Agronski: Ah, so. Well, no - not doing that. Just meant the origin doesn't factor into the naming any more - as you noted, French Fries aren't even French xD
[18:52:45] anjarubik: hmmm something wrong with my client
[18:53:14] XY0908: Chris, absolutely. He also suggested beaming organs with UV.
[18:53:42] XY0908: I know Agro, I was just pulling your leg. :-)
[18:53:48] highhand: Chris (rengo is 3 person waiting game) partly true, but once game starts, usually it creates a game that is good for review
[18:53:58] highhand: now we need 1 more for rengo
[18:54:03] highhand: pandorarengo room
[18:54:06] anjarubik: anyone experience chat overflow? the player names in the chat disappear to the left after long time of inactivity
[18:54:23] XY0908: highhand, I bet domie is a part of the team.
[18:54:31] Chris: I have a better question. Does the name Agronski imply that there are other gronskis?
[18:54:43] kindred: anjarubik, that happens when someone pastes in a very long link
[18:54:55] kindred: then everything in the chat gets shifted to left
[18:55:02] XY0908: remedy: restart the client.
[18:55:17] kindred: or close this room, and re-enter it
[18:55:27] anjarubik: resize the window is ok
[18:55:28] XY0908: or, that.

[19:47:47] puffy: puff on
[19:55:05] Epsilion: hi puff
[19:55:15] Ryukai: What does huff mean?
[19:55:56] Epsilion: it's like a somewhat passively-agressive exhalation
[19:55:59] zico: huff is the sound you make when you breathe out heavily and loudly
[19:58:23] rarara: huff is a derogatory term for someone who is a member of the Wizard Hufflepuff
[19:58:28] Ryukai: So the big bad wolf huffs, and puffs, and blows.  How's he retain consciousness if he only breaths out?
[19:59:13] VIXX: and this room regularly resembles a huff
[19:59:15] VIXX: :)
[20:02:56] Warfreak2: i guess "puff" was already taken as a derogatory term
[20:03:24] Ryukai: Ghostbusters fans?
[20:04:56] Warfreak2: 12. (derogatory, slang, Britain, particularly northern UK) Synonym of poof: a male homosexual, especially an effeminate one.
[20:07:43] TengenBot: Help, I'm the new Prime Minister and I don't know anything about leading a country! Or how to negotiate with other countries? Or how to pay for the government I've started to implement, just so that I can make sure that I win a majority and don't lose it when the global economy tanked on my watch because I spent money on things I should have spent money on?
[20:10:30] AmyTS: I miss dsaun.
[20:14:15] zico: I miss him too
[20:14:15] cronin: We all do.
[20:14:26] Ryukai: ^
[20:19:59] cekalo: is it true that vultures are flying around in new york?
[20:20:39] XY0908: this is how the rumor starts?
[20:21:06] Ryukai: Is it mean to make fun of lawyers?
[20:21:09] XY0908: how rumors start*
[20:21:26] XY0908: vultures don't eat sharks.
[20:22:08] cekalo: they are atrected by smell of dead bodies

[21:40:02] Soromon: hey XY. Looked at your album - I liked the one near the end with the tree

[21:43:46] XY0908: a winter tree, or afternoon walking?
[21:44:00] XY0908: Thank you for viewing.

[21:47:17] ericj: Hi, everyone
[21:47:19] XY0908: Thank you. It's a real landscape since the lock down.
[21:47:31] XY0908: hello good sir, ericj.
[21:47:44] ericj: and to you, XY
[21:48:58] arndt: maybe I should go see if the local Korean restaurant is open
[21:49:01] zico: is there any dentist here?
[21:49:09] arndt: mine is sick
[21:50:05] highhand: are dentists still working?
[21:50:28] highhand: their work generate lots of aerosol
[21:50:32] kindred: probably, for emergencies at least
[21:51:38] zico: I bit something too hard, and one of my tooth chipped. I wonder whether I should do dental filling and how much does it usually cost
[21:51:39] highhand: what kind of emergencies exist, besides injury?
[21:52:48] highhand: inquiry as in car accidents, else all can defer for 6 months to a year?
[21:53:12] XY0908: ouch, zico. should see a doctor quickly under the circumcetance- don't delay, because the problem will get bigger.
[21:53:12] kindred: a molar tooth can break if you bite on something
[21:54:00] highhand: losing a tooth is real bad, but not life threatening, maybe some kind of dental infections are emergencies
[21:54:14] Ryukai: So an apple a day might keep the doctor away, but the dentist will be lurking around the corner?
[21:54:14] zico: yeah, mine is molar, and it chipped into a big cavity. sometimes when I eat, things slip into the cavity, and it's troublesome to pick it out with toothpick everytime I eat
[21:54:26] kindred: have you had it happen, highhand? it becomes difficult to eat something
[21:55:06] arndt: I'm in the process of having a tooth fixed
[21:55:13] highhand: I do not know. I certainly have big gaps everywhere, teeth, brain, etc
[21:55:16] arndt: it's stable but needs another visit
[21:55:18] XY0908: McMaster is on! Good! What a relief!
[21:55:26] arndt: the dentist had a plastic mask
[21:55:36] arndt: or what the word is
[21:56:31] zico: face schield?
[21:56:52] XY0908: ski mask?
[21:57:05] zico: I mean *face shield
[21:57:16] arndt: not ski mask, a more like shield
[21:57:21] XY0908: :-)
[21:57:23] highhand: space helmet
[21:57:25] zico: ski mask?? XY, dentists are not robbers
[21:57:35] XY0908: they are, zico.
[21:57:43] XY0908: look at the bills.
[21:57:50] zico: well, you're right. haha
[21:57:56] highhand: a reaper mask
[21:58:04] XY0908: (that's why I said ski mask)
[21:58:25] XY0908: 30 minutes of cleaning= $185
[21:58:37] highhand: are there lots of lawsuits against dentists? that drive up costs
[21:58:39] zico: but, the bills come with the costs. the dental equipments are so expensive
[21:59:20] XY0908: you are willing to pay $60 for a cookie because the baking equipment is expensive?
[21:59:36] JIeBuc: some peopel do
[21:59:46] XY0908: O_O
[21:59:56] zico: that's why I want to know whether there are denstists here or not. Maybe they can explain why it's so expensive
[22:00:08] Ryukai: Some of us can make a -really- good cookie.
[22:00:22] JIeBuc: I think material+equipment+salary
[22:00:38] XY0908: what about the time?
[22:00:52] JIeBuc: for example, 100$ for 5-minute consultation with a doctor is expensive or not?
[22:01:08] XY0908: Expensive, of course.
[22:01:18] zico: for me, that's expensive but, it is partially covered by insurance
[22:01:18] JIeBuc: But that's usually around that price
[22:01:27] JIeBuc: 50-100$
[22:01:49] JIeBuc: and it's price just for time and education
[22:02:02] JIeBuc: if we add material, it becomes even more
[22:02:05] XY0908: wheather it's covered or not, it's still expensive. At the end it's US who will pay for the insurance cost.
[22:02:34] Agronski: Big Tooth doesn't want you to fix your own teeth with polymer repair kits from Amazon. That and the Tooth Fairy Mafia.
[22:02:37] highhand: $100 for a 5min consultation is cheap, if that results in a life changing attitude shift
[22:03:33] zico: lol. that's funny, hh
[22:04:02] XY0908: I wonder how many doctors give a hoot about Hippocratic Oath these days.
[22:04:13] JIeBuc: for many people price depends not on spent time, but overall amount of clients
[22:04:25] ericj: The vast majority, XY
[22:04:36] XY0908: really?
[22:04:39] JIeBuc: if person wants to have 200$ day and has only 2 clients, then it's going to be 100$
[22:04:44] Ryukai: Doctors are typically good people with greedy bosses.
[22:04:45] ericj: I spoke with one last night, in fact, and he definitely does.
[22:04:46] zikego: teeth are like shoes or cars they show your social level.
[22:05:10] ericj: He works with aging folks in the southwest of Wyoming. Has been working really really hard to maintain his facilities covid-free. Really good guy.
[22:05:19] zikego: So theyy are expensive
[22:05:20] arndt: once there was a doctor examining me for a health insurance, paid by my company, and his role seemed to be to identify areas which the insurance wouldn't cover
[22:05:23] highhand: I hope its more than you think. People went thru a lot for that training. If they have a certain mentality it helped them make it to the end
[22:05:26] ericj: In fact, all the doctors I know are typically very caring people.
[22:05:42] XY0908: ericj, I think you're confused it with being Hypocrisy
[22:05:46] arndt: the company then chose another insurance
[22:06:11] ericj: XY, not at all. I have not met any like that. A few that I felt were arrogant, but still, caring and skilled.
[22:06:34] XY0908: You win. And stop being so series.
[22:06:46] bert: i go with eric on this
[22:06:50] JIeBuc: But I agree dentists are expensive
[22:06:53] Ryukai: With the amount of sheer time and effort required to become a doctor, it's perfectly fair to be a bit smug you accomplished it.  xD
[22:07:07] XY0908: In my experience, 60% of doctors care more about money.
[22:07:44] Ryukai: Not the doctor's fault for the most part though.
[22:07:48] XY0908: 90% in lawyers.
[22:07:52] zikego: and 90% of ppl too
[22:07:53] ericj: I know, Ryukai. The most arrogant I met was the guy who fixed my knee. "It's gonna be better than before!" etc :)
[22:08:00] JIeBuc: In my country doctors have one of the lowest salaries
[22:08:13] ericj: I recall thinking two things: 1) I want you to be the one who does this surgery, and 2) I'm glad we're not friends hahahaha
[22:08:18] zico: don't tell me you're in Cuba, JleBuc
[22:08:22] JIeBuc: nope
[22:08:48] ericj: Here it's so high because the system is so messed up. A doctor's malpractice insurance can run several hundred thousand a year.
[22:08:50] XY0908: teachers are the ones who get paid the least in most countries.
[22:08:54] Ryukai: It isn't the doctor who decides the price of treatment, they're just the guy who tells you you're gonna need it.  xD
[22:08:57] JIeBuc: so basically anyone who went to work as doctor just a kind person, who wants to help
[22:09:18] highhand: in PRC doctors sometimes become victims of violence, from family of patients
[22:09:27] zikego: From what i hear from medias medical staff are suffering a bit for money,means... in western countries
[22:09:39] Ryukai: You can always choose to sell cheap, but you can't always choose to buy cheap.
[22:09:44] highhand: I do not think the average doctor there is that highly paid
[22:10:08] zikego: France, Spain Prtugal at least but ididnt check thers
[22:10:26] zikego: others
[22:10:54] XY0908: I think doctors fee differ greatly by countries. I read it somewhere the same knee surgery costs 6 times higher in the US than Sweden.
[22:11:13] ericj: it's our insurance system + litigiousness :-/
[22:11:19] Ryukai: Capitalism is fun.
[22:11:25] ericj: mine was in 2009 and they billed the insurance company $24,000
[22:11:26] XY0908: yes, eric.
[22:12:04] zikego: And many times doctors just cant solve problems inducing the bad health (wars, poverty,...)
[22:12:17] XY0908: Mine was about $8,500 for torn meniscus surgery.
[22:12:22] bert: of course, dentists are a completely different case
[22:12:30] Ryukai: Doctor's fees essentially come down to what they have to pay to operate.  Being affordable often means they're bleeding funds.
[22:12:36] ericj: a repair, XY, or a partial meniscotomy?
[22:12:44] JIeBuc: isn't that a kind of fraud?
[22:12:46] ericj: (cutting off / cleaning up)
[22:12:50] XY0908: All dentists should watch Little Shop of Horror.
[22:12:58] Ryukai: Please no.
[22:13:01] ericj: Feed me, Seymour! :)
[22:13:05] XY0908: cutting off, then stapled.
[22:13:14] highhand: US institutions for medical services are atrocious. Europe seem to overdo it in the other extreme. France, for example?
[22:13:15] Ryukai: Needles are scary enough.  Don't give them more ideas.
[22:13:29] XY0908: or, Marathon Man
[22:13:58] ericj: Gotcha, XY. Mine was repairable, so I had meniscus repair + acl reconstruction
[22:14:15] XY0908: that costed $24,000?
[22:14:29] Xorax: US is weird... having to pay for stuff like insulin should be a crime xD
[22:14:30] XY0908: including the rehab?
[22:14:58] zikego: England has one of most expensive policy ppl contribute a loy to the healthcare, highland
[22:15:03] ericj: Well, they billed 24k for it. The rehab took 18 sessions of PT at about 150 a pop? but through a different provider
[22:15:28] zikego: more as in France ithink
[22:15:35] XY0908: The rehab costed a lot for me.
[22:17:01] XY0908: and in the end, I didn't feel much difference.
[22:17:28] highhand: UK is very unEuropean, thats the impression I get from far away.
[22:17:37] XY0908: The insurance denied after few sessions so I had to pay out of pocket
[22:18:10] XY0908: highhand, that's why Brexit
[22:18:11] Muttley: zikego, you got a reference for that?
[22:18:49] ericj: that's weird, xy, and very strange. my rehab was extremely effective, got me from unable to move the leg to full function in those 18 sessions, I mean, playing soccer again full function
[22:19:03] Muttley: It's a country with universal healthcare that is funded out of taxation :))
[22:19:27] XY0908: ericj, I think it has to do with the age.
[22:19:30] ericj: I agree with you, Xorax.
[22:19:40] ericj: Could be, XY :)
[22:20:15] XY0908: they should charge nothing for insulin, but charge 10 times more for Botox.
[22:20:33] Ryukai: Just start charging a tax for using literally incorrectly.
[22:20:37] ericj: Botox is already sold close to price, and largely not covered by insurance, XY
[22:20:37] XY0908: Botox for cosmetic purpose.
[22:20:48] rubicon: That would literally be tax fraud
[22:21:56] XY0908: rubicon
[22:22:06] XY0908: any chance for season 2?
[22:22:39] XY0908: (sorry- I couldn't help)
[22:23:46] XY0908: ericj, again on the rehab, maybe also I wasn't diligent enough with the follow up.
[22:24:04] XY0908: <--- hates exercise
[22:24:11] ericj: well, if you quit after just a couple sessions, that would be very bad.
[22:24:24] XY0908: I did about 30 sessions.
[22:24:37] ericj: I mean, at the end, I would lie on my stomach with a rope around my foot, pulling it very hard to increase range of motion
[22:24:39] XY0908: but my mind was somewhere else.
[22:25:51] XY0908: time to eat. bye guys.
[22:25:55] ericj: later!
[22:25:59] XY0908: and girls.
[22:27:13] JIeBuc: there are no girls on kgs
[22:28:10] PEPFAR: only FBI agents
[22:28:18] Muttley: zsi for a start, J
[22:28:23] Muttley: only a pro :)
[22:28:38] Muttley: Who is actually online now :D
[22:28:48] Ryukai: 50/50
[22:29:33] Muttley: Anyway, I'm going to see how I fare taking 40 stones against cheater.  Could be a long game.
[22:29:40] Muttley: I lost.
[22:29:57] Ryukai: Close.
[22:30:18] Muttley: I was doing OK placing te handicap stones
[22:30:25] Muttley: things went downhill after that.
[22:30:57] Ryukai: At least your first 40 stones were alright.
[22:31:54] Ryukai: He's just sitting there.
[22:31:56] Ryukai: Menacingly.
[22:36:34] zikego: Dont be so shy, some of my best memories were playing a game with a pro
[22:37:29] Ryukai: Wait what.
[22:37:32] zikego: its like playing with a book alive, how wonderful their moves
[22:37:44] Ryukai: Who are we talking about?
[22:38:09] zikego: cheater
[22:38:15] Ryukai: Oic.
[22:38:47] Ryukai: Sneaky pros.
[22:39:13] Ryukai: *Menace Intensifies*
[22:59:35] domie: a fourth 3k-7d in Kurohata RENGO ?
[23:03:32] Ryukai: Woah, that was a lot of us just lurking.
[23:04:21] Muttley: Flushdraw 9d - Cheater, people :D
[23:10:13] AmyTS: warble
[23:12:22] cronin: g'evening
[23:19:31] Ryukai: Yello'.
[23:25:58] cronin: is there a pro review room?
[23:26:36] mongo: i think so
[23:26:47] mongo: a teacher room..
[23:27:06] cronin: *mystery intensifies*
[23:27:55] LinuxGooo: hello ... g`d evening
[23:28:46] cronin: can I ask an OGS question here?
[23:29:00] cronin: (where is everyone?)
[23:29:00] bolbi: why not?
[23:29:47] mongo: you mean the server that cannot be named?
[23:30:02] AmyTS: oh no
[23:30:21] zikego: so?
[23:30:22] LinuxGooo: pst... dont speak it out loudly, mongo. OGS may not be named on KGS. Dont name it. :-)
[23:30:35] cronin: you see it too? :(
[23:30:42] AmyTS: See what?
[23:30:48] cronin: the nothingness
[23:30:52] cronin: no games being played, etc
[23:30:55] AmyTS: On OGS?  Yes.
[23:31:18] cronin: is that normal?
[23:31:29] zikego: lot of correspondance games
[23:31:30] AmyTS: dunno, i hadn't logged in since 2015.
[23:31:37] cronin: ohh
[23:31:45] zikego: like 1 move 3 days
[23:31:56] zikego: or a week depends
[23:32:08] Muttley: cronin, OGS is having a day of mourning today
[23:32:19] Muttley: because Go Seigen died.
[23:32:27] Muttley: news travels slowly on OGS
[23:32:56] rarara: OGS is not succesful?  There is only one reason.
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: what ???? :-)
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: The OGS Nirwana
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: correspondence games had been always majority on OGS. Very normal.
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: hm ... but thats long time ago. :-)
[23:33:44] LinuxGooo: I mean, its long time gone when Go Seigen died. OGS folks are little bit late to mourn now. :-)
[23:34:03] cronin: there might be something wrong with my browser
[23:34:12] AmyTS: OGS is populated with Ents.  they take a long time to mourn.
[23:34:25] LinuxGooo: Ents ???
[23:34:40] PEPFAR: trees
[23:34:47] AmyTS: the talking trees from Lord of the Rings.  they take all morning to say hello.
[23:34:55] Muttley: What browser are you using?
[23:35:00] cronin: all of them
[23:35:09] LinuxGooo: aha ....
[23:35:10] cronin: i checked from mobile - same story
[23:35:12] Muttley: Have you tried Netscape?
[23:35:14] domie: what brother are you using ?*
[23:35:26] Muttley: That's the best with OGS
[23:35:28] AmyTS: use the older brother.
[23:35:33] Muttley: they haven't updated since 1990
[23:35:36] cronin: either I have been banned or this mourning thing might be true
[23:35:52] gghh: probably some server problem
[23:35:56] Muttley: Well, I'm here to kick butt or chew gum, and I'm all out of mourning
[23:35:57] cronin: given the propension to light trolling of the admins i wouldn't trust what they say
[23:36:00] Muttley: so it ain't that
[23:36:01] gghh: backend not responding
[23:36:14] Muttley: porbably a server problem at their end
[23:36:15] AmyTS: what time is it there muttley?  you're out of morning too.
[23:36:25] Muttley: kadum tssch
[23:36:49] Muttley: you know you can check whether sites are accepting connections on the internet
[23:36:58] cronin: yes
[23:37:39] Muttley: you have your answer in that case
[23:37:59] cronin: uhm, M-W says "propension" is archaic and i should use "propensity" instead
[23:38:16] AmyTS: i popped open the dev tools for OGS and didn't see any failed XHR or WS requests.  it all looks normal.  just empty.
[23:38:24] zikego: On OGS for mea culpa, you have some good work on the new josekis from AI
[23:38:37] AmyTS: the site is a fully functional ghost town
[23:38:51] rarara: OGS is down :(
[23:38:55] rarara: Code blue!  Code blue!
[23:39:05] zikego: Search in the puzzles
[23:39:12] cronin: it's lowkey annoying that admins, aside from their light trolling, have also this kind of "i know more than u" superiority aura, as if somebody asking a question necessarily is also an ingenue in all other regards
[23:39:44] cronin: thanks Amy
[23:39:45] zikego: cronin admin! lets move
[23:40:00] rarara: What's even worse is when Guests make amazing insightful comments.
[23:40:46] Muttley: You can't try to help some people without them taking offence, no matter what you do :))
[23:40:49] Muttley: lesson learned.
[23:40:59] zikego: I m sure should get bored to stay admin all time
[23:41:14] Agronski: Tone, Muttley. Tone.
[23:41:30] Muttley: I'm using the bridge pick up
[23:41:41] Agronski: Put it back down, then.
[23:42:22] AmyTS: Increase the tone by 20 hz.
[23:42:44] Agronski: Hmm.
[23:42:48] Agronski: </pun>
[23:48:15] Ryukai: That's a strong ish, if anyone is looking.
[23:49:35] rarara: I am sad, is OGS broken for good, or is it just today?
[23:51:32] Wrenn: In what way is OGS broken? Only thing I see wrong is the indicator for how many games it is your move in did not appear.
[23:51:52] rarara: there are 0 games being played
[23:51:52] AmyTS: I see no games, no chat, no logged-in users.
[23:52:04] cronin: me too :(
[23:52:28] cronin: some days ago there was a major screw-up by one of the main coders
[23:52:35] cronin: that terminated a ton of games
[23:52:40] cronin: maybe they're at it again
[23:53:01] zikego: you can see some OGS blitz in the corona room
[23:53:58] AmyTS: i see chat and logged in users now.
[23:54:13] AmyTS: and games.
[23:55:12] cronin: wow, indeed!" they're back with a vengeance!
[23:56:33] zico: the cases of COVID-19 in the US almost reached a million, while the second country with the most COVID-19 is Spain with a little bit over 200 thousand. I guess the US does really want to be number one at everything
[23:56:57] zikego: @Amy+1
[23:57:08] Wrenn: (zico, without giving per capita numbers, that statistic is pointless :P)
[23:58:05] cronin: i thought this was a virus free room
[23:58:40] rarara: Yes, but USA is actually believable in counting
[23:59:03] rarara: we did it!  We keep KGS running, and now we saved OGS too!

[08:00:44] TengenBot: Now on store shelves everywhere: TengenBot souveniers! This set includes a number of TengenBots (not Tengen Monsters, which are very different, and I don't know why) plus a ridiculously useful (and easy to use!) store centipede that comes with six common tools! Now you can easily store, move, and reinforce your tools all at the same time!

[12:25:02] ApplePie: do they sell pies in walmart?
[12:25:08] meyerX: maybe
[12:25:12] meyerX: you have to find out
[12:25:13] ApplePie: ok
[12:26:23] meyerX: have you downloaded their app?
[12:26:42] ApplePie: no I haven't 
[12:26:48] ApplePie: I probably should
[12:27:08] ApplePie: I usually just go to costco, food4less and 99 ranch

[12:28:54] ApplePie: me too
[12:29:11] meyerX: but my local walmart stops providing them
[12:29:13] meyerX: i'm mad
[12:29:30] ApplePie: dang
[12:30:29] ApplePie: try some other supermarkets 
[12:31:53] meyerX: and my favourite sushi restaurant in town does not  offer takeaway
[12:31:59] meyerX: i'm mad *2
[12:33:10] ApplePie: are they still open??
[12:33:17] meyerX: yup
[12:33:23] ApplePie: wow
[12:33:33] ApplePie: you can just dine in then

[17:42:59] highhand: rengo game is a 4 person game, not everyone knows this
[17:50:56] Chris: that is factually incorrect. rengo is a 3 person game of waiting for a fourth
[17:51:09] Kingu: lol

[18:05:15] Kingu: aka “the Beckett game”

[18:33:28] XY0908: Good morning.
[18:33:43] ummjhall: good evening
[18:33:45] XY0908: What's GoUniverse please?
[18:36:19] XY0908: Ok, I have more interesting question: Is English Muffin actually originated from England? Or is it used as French in French Fries?
[18:38:38] cronin: Hi
[18:39:31] cronin: GoUniverse is the awesome chrome extension that offers a client to kgs 
[18:39:41] cronin: Written by kocmohabt
[18:39:58] Agronski: Think "English Muffin" is used to distinguish them from US "muffins" which are more like cupcakes. Whether or not they originate from England isn't really important.
[18:41:49] XY0908: Thanks both. Agronski, hope you are not acting like a teacher I had when I was in elementary school, sixty years ago.
[18:42:37] rarara: The Lyre bird pretends to be other birds and can imitate their singing.
[18:47:23] Agronski: Acting how?
[18:50:28] XY0908: there was a teacher, an old man, who would say "It's not important." when we, 7 year old children, asked questions and he didn't know the answers. 
[18:51:10] XY0908: You know, 7 years could have many unexpected questions.
[18:52:15] Chris: that's at least better than making stuff up like we should inject ourselves with lysol to prevent covid
[18:52:18] XY0908: full of wonderful ideas and totally curious about everything.
[18:52:32] Agronski: Ah, so. Well, no - not doing that. Just meant the origin doesn't factor into the naming any more - as you noted, French Fries aren't even French xD
[18:52:45] anjarubik: hmmm something wrong with my client
[18:53:14] XY0908: Chris, absolutely. He also suggested beaming organs with UV.
[18:53:42] XY0908: I know Agro, I was just pulling your leg. :-)
[18:53:48] highhand: Chris (rengo is 3 person waiting game) partly true, but once game starts, usually it creates a game that is good for review
[18:53:58] highhand: now we need 1 more for rengo
[18:54:03] highhand: pandorarengo room
[18:54:06] anjarubik: anyone experience chat overflow? the player names in the chat disappear to the left after long time of inactivity
[18:54:23] XY0908: highhand, I bet domie is a part of the team.
[18:54:31] Chris: I have a better question. Does the name Agronski imply that there are other gronskis?
[18:54:43] kindred: anjarubik, that happens when someone pastes in a very long link
[18:54:55] kindred: then everything in the chat gets shifted to left
[18:55:02] XY0908: remedy: restart the client.
[18:55:17] kindred: or close this room, and re-enter it
[18:55:27] anjarubik: resize the window is ok
[18:55:28] XY0908: or, that.

[19:55:05] Epsilion: hi puff
[19:55:15] Ryukai: What does huff mean?
[19:55:56] Epsilion: it's like a somewhat passively-agressive exhalation
[19:55:59] zico: huff is the sound you make when you breathe out heavily and loudly
[19:58:23] rarara: huff is a derogatory term for someone who is a member of the Wizard Hufflepuff
[19:58:28] Ryukai: So the big bad wolf huffs, and puffs, and blows.  How's he retain consciousness if he only breaths out?
[19:59:13] VIXX: and this room regularly resembles a huff
[19:59:15] VIXX: :)
[20:02:56] Warfreak2: i guess "puff" was already taken as a derogatory term
[20:03:24] Ryukai: Ghostbusters fans?
[20:04:56] Warfreak2: 12. (derogatory, slang, Britain, particularly northern UK) Synonym of poof: a male homosexual, especially an effeminate one.
[20:07:43] TengenBot: Help, I'm the new Prime Minister and I don't know anything about leading a country! Or how to negotiate with other countries? Or how to pay for the government I've started to implement, just so that I can make sure that I win a majority and don't lose it when the global economy tanked on my watch because I spent money on things I should have spent money on?

[20:19:59] cekalo: is it true that vultures are flying around in new york?
[20:20:39] XY0908: this is how the rumor starts?
[20:21:06] Ryukai: Is it mean to make fun of lawyers?
[20:21:09] XY0908: how rumors start*
[20:21:26] XY0908: vultures don't eat sharks.
[20:22:08] cekalo: they are atrected by smell of dead bodies
[20:37:36] BrandonMLG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvOLb9LKOoA
[20:43:03] Epsilion: they've been there for a while now cekalo, they're called wall street speculators

[20:45:41] dayharri: it is called "Steeeve Maaadden".
[20:59:11] cronin: Bloody bitcoin hoarders
[21:02:19] Agronski: Even less useful than money hoarders - at least you can use dollars as toilet paper, or vice-versa, depending on the economy.

[21:39:25] XY0908: Good morning, good sir Herod.
[21:40:02] Soromon: hey XY. Looked at your album - I liked the one near the end with the tree
[21:40:50] Soromon: I forget the name - two words
[21:43:46] XY0908: a winter tree, or afternoon walking?
[21:44:00] XY0908: Thank you for viewing.
[21:45:41] Soromon: afternoon walking
[21:47:17] ericj: Hi, everyone
[21:47:19] XY0908: Thank you. It's a real landscape since the lock down.
[21:47:31] XY0908: hello good sir, ericj.
[21:47:44] ericj: and to you, XY 
[21:48:58] arndt: maybe I should go see if the local Korean restaurant is open
[21:49:01] zico: is there any dentist here?
[21:49:09] arndt: mine is sick
[21:50:05] highhand: are dentists still working?
[21:50:28] highhand: their work generate lots of aerosol
[21:50:32] kindred: probably, for emergencies at least
[21:51:38] zico: I bit something too hard, and one of my tooth chipped. I wonder whether I should do dental filling and how much does it usually cost
[21:51:39] highhand: what kind of emergencies exist, besides injury?
[21:52:48] highhand: inquiry as in car accidents, else all can defer for 6 months to a year?
[21:53:12] XY0908: ouch, zico. should see a doctor quickly under the circumcetance- don't delay, because the problem will get bigger.
[21:53:12] kindred: a molar tooth can break if you bite on something
[21:54:00] highhand: losing a tooth is real bad, but not life threatening, maybe some kind of dental infections are emergencies
[21:54:14] Ryukai: So an apple a day might keep the doctor away, but the dentist will be lurking around the corner?
[21:54:14] zico: yeah, mine is molar, and it chipped into a big cavity. sometimes when I eat, things slip into the cavity, and it's troublesome to pick it out with toothpick everytime I eat
[21:54:26] kindred: have you had it happen, highhand? it becomes difficult to eat something
[21:55:06] arndt: I'm in the process of having a tooth fixed
[21:55:13] highhand: I do not know. I certainly have big gaps everywhere, teeth, brain, etc
[21:55:16] arndt: it's stable but needs another visit
[21:55:18] XY0908: McMaster is on! Good! What a relief!
[21:55:26] arndt: the dentist had a plastic mask
[21:55:36] arndt: or what the word is
[21:56:31] zico: face schield?
[21:56:52] XY0908: ski mask?
[21:57:05] zico: I mean *face shield
[21:57:16] arndt: not ski mask, a more like shield
[21:57:21] XY0908: :-)
[21:57:23] highhand: space helmet
[21:57:25] zico: ski mask?? XY, dentists are not robbers
[21:57:35] XY0908: they are, zico.
[21:57:43] XY0908: look at the bills.
[21:57:50] zico: well, you're right. haha
[21:57:56] highhand: a reaper mask
[21:58:04] XY0908: (that's why I said ski mask)
[21:58:25] XY0908: 30 minutes of cleaning= $185
[21:58:37] highhand: are there lots of lawsuits against dentists? that drive up costs
[21:58:39] zico: but, the bills come with the costs. the dental equipments are so expensive
[21:59:20] XY0908: you are willing to pay $60 for a cookie because the baking equipment is expensive?
[21:59:36] JIeBuc: some peopel do
[21:59:46] XY0908: O_O
[21:59:56] zico: that's why I want to know whether there are denstists here or not. Maybe they can explain why it's so expensive
[22:00:08] Ryukai: Some of us can make a -really- good cookie.
[22:00:22] JIeBuc: I think material+equipment+salary
[22:00:38] XY0908: what about the time?
[22:00:52] JIeBuc: for example, 100$ for 5-minute consultation with a doctor is expensive or not?
[22:01:08] XY0908: Expensive, of course.
[22:01:18] zico: for me, that's expensive but, it is partially covered by insurance
[22:01:18] JIeBuc: But that's usually around that price
[22:01:27] JIeBuc: 50-100$
[22:01:49] JIeBuc: and it's price just for time and education
[22:02:02] JIeBuc: if we add material, it becomes even more
[22:02:05] XY0908: wheather it's covered or not, it's still expensive. At the end it's US who will pay for the insurance cost.
[22:02:34] Agronski: Big Tooth doesn't want you to fix your own teeth with polymer repair kits from Amazon. That and the Tooth Fairy Mafia.
[22:02:37] highhand: $100 for a 5min consultation is cheap, if that results in a life changing attitude shift
[22:03:33] zico: lol. that's funny, hh
[22:04:02] XY0908: I wonder how many doctors give a hoot about Hippocratic Oath these days.
[22:04:13] JIeBuc: for many people price depends not on spent time, but overall amount of clients
[22:04:25] ericj: The vast majority, XY
[22:04:36] XY0908: really?
[22:04:39] JIeBuc: if person wants to have 200$ day and has only 2 clients, then it's going to be 100$
[22:04:44] Ryukai: Doctors are typically good people with greedy bosses.
[22:04:45] ericj: I spoke with one last night, in fact, and he definitely does.
[22:04:46] zikego: teeth are like shoes or cars they show your social level.
[22:05:10] ericj: He works with aging folks in the southwest of Wyoming. Has been working really really hard to maintain his facilities covid-free. Really good guy.
[22:05:19] zikego: So theyy are expensive
[22:05:20] arndt: once there was a doctor examining me for a health insurance, paid by my company, and his role seemed to be to identify areas which the insurance wouldn't cover
[22:05:23] highhand: I hope its more than you think. People went thru a lot for that training. If they have a certain mentality it helped them make it to the end
[22:05:26] ericj: In fact, all the doctors I know are typically very caring people. 
[22:05:42] XY0908: ericj, I think you're confused it with being Hypocrisy
[22:05:46] arndt: the company then chose another insurance
[22:06:11] ericj: XY, not at all. I have not met any like that. A few that I felt were arrogant, but still, caring and skilled.
[22:06:34] XY0908: You win. And stop being so series.
[22:06:46] bert: i go with eric on this
[22:06:50] JIeBuc: But I agree dentists are expensive
[22:06:53] Ryukai: With the amount of sheer time and effort required to become a doctor, it's perfectly fair to be a bit smug you accomplished it.  xD
[22:07:07] XY0908: In my experience, 60% of doctors care more about money.
[22:07:44] Ryukai: Not the doctor's fault for the most part though.
[22:07:48] XY0908: 90% in lawyers.
[22:07:52] zikego: and 90% of ppl too
[22:07:53] ericj: I know, Ryukai. The most arrogant I met was the guy who fixed my knee. "It's gonna be better than before!" etc :)
[22:08:00] JIeBuc: In my country doctors have one of the lowest salaries
[22:08:13] ericj: I recall thinking two things: 1) I want you to be the one who does this surgery, and 2) I'm glad we're not friends hahahaha
[22:08:18] zico: don't tell me you're in Cuba, JleBuc
[22:08:22] JIeBuc: nope
[22:08:48] ericj: Here it's so high because the system is so messed up. A doctor's malpractice insurance can run several hundred thousand a year.
[22:08:50] XY0908: teachers are the ones who get paid the least in most countries.
[22:08:54] Ryukai: It isn't the doctor who decides the price of treatment, they're just the guy who tells you you're gonna need it.  xD
[22:08:57] JIeBuc: so basically anyone who went to work as doctor just a kind person, who wants to help
[22:09:18] highhand: in PRC doctors sometimes become victims of violence, from family of patients
[22:09:27] zikego: From what i hear from medias medical staff are suffering a bit for money,means... in western countries
[22:09:39] Ryukai: You can always choose to sell cheap, but you can't always choose to buy cheap.
[22:09:44] highhand: I do not think the average doctor there is that highly paid
[22:10:08] zikego: France, Spain Prtugal at least but ididnt check thers
[22:10:26] zikego: others
[22:10:54] XY0908: I think doctors fee differ greatly by countries. I read it somewhere the same knee surgery costs 6 times higher in the US than Sweden.
[22:11:13] ericj: it's our insurance system + litigiousness :-/
[22:11:19] Ryukai: Capitalism is fun.
[22:11:25] ericj: mine was in 2009 and they billed the insurance company $24,000 
[22:11:26] XY0908: yes, eric.
[22:12:04] zikego: And many times doctors just cant solve problems inducing the bad health (wars, poverty,...)
[22:12:17] XY0908: Mine was about $8,500 for torn meniscus surgery.
[22:12:22] bert: of course, dentists are a completely different case 
[22:12:30] Ryukai: Doctor's fees essentially come down to what they have to pay to operate.  Being affordable often means they're bleeding funds.
[22:12:36] ericj: a repair, XY, or a partial meniscotomy?
[22:12:44] JIeBuc: isn't that a kind of fraud?
[22:12:46] ericj: (cutting off / cleaning up)
[22:12:50] XY0908: All dentists should watch Little Shop of Horror.
[22:12:58] Ryukai: Please no.
[22:13:01] ericj: Feed me, Seymour! :)
[22:13:05] XY0908: cutting off, then stapled.
[22:13:14] highhand: US institutions for medical services are atrocious. Europe seem to overdo it in the other extreme. France, for example?
[22:13:15] Ryukai: Needles are scary enough.  Don't give them more ideas.
[22:13:29] XY0908: or, Marathon Man
[22:13:58] ericj: Gotcha, XY. Mine was repairable, so I had meniscus repair + acl reconstruction
[22:14:15] XY0908: that costed $24,000?
[22:14:29] Xorax: US is weird... having to pay for stuff like insulin should be a crime xD
[22:14:30] XY0908: including the rehab?
[22:14:58] zikego: England has one of most expensive policy ppl contribute a loy to the healthcare, highland
[22:15:03] ericj: Well, they billed 24k for it. The rehab took 18 sessions of PT at about 150 a pop? but through a different provider
[22:15:28] zikego: more as in France ithink
[22:15:35] XY0908: The rehab costed a lot for me.
[22:17:01] XY0908: and in the end, I didn't feel much difference.
[22:17:28] highhand: UK is very unEuropean, thats the impression I get from far away. 
[22:17:37] XY0908: The insurance denied after few sessions so I had to pay out of pocket
[22:18:10] XY0908: highhand, that's why Brexit
[22:18:11] Muttley: zikego, you got a reference for that?
[22:18:49] ericj: that's weird, xy, and very strange. my rehab was extremely effective, got me from unable to move the leg to full function in those 18 sessions, I mean, playing soccer again full function
[22:19:03] Muttley: It's a country with universal healthcare that is funded out of taxation :))
[22:19:27] XY0908: ericj, I think it has to do with the age.
[22:19:30] ericj: I agree with you, Xorax. 
[22:19:40] ericj: Could be, XY :) 
[22:20:15] XY0908: they should charge nothing for insulin, but charge 10 times more for Botox.
[22:20:33] Ryukai: Just start charging a tax for using literally incorrectly.
[22:20:37] ericj: Botox is already sold close to price, and largely not covered by insurance, XY
[22:20:37] XY0908: Botox for cosmetic purpose.
[22:20:48] rubicon: That would literally be tax fraud
[22:21:56] XY0908: rubicon
[22:22:06] XY0908: any chance for season 2?
[22:22:39] XY0908: (sorry- I couldn't help)
[22:23:46] XY0908: ericj, again on the rehab, maybe also I wasn't diligent enough with the follow up.
[22:24:04] XY0908: <--- hates exercise
[22:24:11] ericj: well, if you quit after just a couple sessions, that would be very bad. 
[22:24:24] XY0908: I did about 30 sessions.
[22:24:37] ericj: I mean, at the end, I would lie on my stomach with a rope around my foot, pulling it very hard to increase range of motion
[22:24:39] XY0908: but my mind was somewhere else.
[22:25:51] XY0908: time to eat. bye guys.
[22:25:55] ericj: later!
[22:25:59] XY0908: and girls.
[22:27:13] JIeBuc: there are no girls on kgs
[22:28:10] PEPFAR: only FBI agents
[22:28:18] Muttley: zsi for a start, J
[22:28:23] Muttley: only a pro :)
[22:28:38] Muttley: Who is actually online now :D
[22:28:48] Ryukai: 50/50
[22:29:33] Muttley: Anyway, I'm going to see how I fare taking 40 stones against cheater.  Could be a long game.
[22:29:40] Muttley: I lost.
[22:29:57] Ryukai: Close.
[22:30:18] Muttley: I was doing OK placing te handicap stones
[22:30:25] Muttley: things went downhill after that.
[22:30:57] Ryukai: At least your first 40 stones were alright.
[22:31:54] Ryukai: He's just sitting there.
[22:31:56] Ryukai: Menacingly.
[22:36:34] zikego: Dont be so shy, some of my best memories were playing a game with a pro
[22:37:29] Ryukai: Wait what.
[22:37:32] zikego: its like playing with a book alive, how wonderful their moves
[22:37:44] Ryukai: Who are we talking about?
[22:38:09] zikego: cheater
[22:38:15] Ryukai: Oic.
[22:38:47] Ryukai: Sneaky pros.
[22:39:13] Ryukai: *Menace Intensifies*
[22:59:35] domie: a fourth 3k-7d in Kurohata RENGO ?
[23:03:32] Ryukai: Woah, that was a lot of us just lurking.
[23:04:21] Muttley: Flushdraw 9d - Cheater, people :D
[23:10:13] AmyTS: warble
[23:12:22] cronin: g'evening

[23:25:58] cronin: is there a pro review room?
[23:26:36] mongo: i think so
[23:26:47] mongo: a teacher room..
[23:27:06] cronin: *mystery intensifies*
[23:27:55] LinuxGooo: hello ... g`d evening 
[23:28:46] cronin: can I ask an OGS question here?
[23:29:00] cronin: (where is everyone?)
[23:29:00] bolbi: why not?
[23:29:47] mongo: you mean the server that cannot be named?
[23:30:02] AmyTS: oh no
[23:30:21] zikego: so?
[23:30:22] LinuxGooo: pst... dont speak it out loudly, mongo. OGS may not be named on KGS. Dont name it. :-) 
[23:30:35] cronin: you see it too? :(
[23:30:42] AmyTS: See what?
[23:30:48] cronin: the nothingness
[23:30:52] cronin: no games being played, etc
[23:30:55] AmyTS: On OGS?  Yes.
[23:31:18] cronin: is that normal? 
[23:31:29] zikego: lot of correspondance games
[23:31:30] AmyTS: dunno, i hadn't logged in since 2015.
[23:31:37] cronin: ohh
[23:31:45] zikego: like 1 move 3 days
[23:31:56] zikego: or a week depends
[23:32:08] Muttley: cronin, OGS is having a day of mourning today
[23:32:19] Muttley: because Go Seigen died.
[23:32:27] Muttley: news travels slowly on OGS
[23:32:56] rarara: OGS is not succesful?  There is only one reason.
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: what ???? :-) 
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: The OGS Nirwana 
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: correspondence games had been always majority on OGS. Very normal. 
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: hm ... but thats long time ago. :-) 
[23:33:44] LinuxGooo: I mean, its long time gone when Go Seigen died. OGS folks are little bit late to mourn now. :-) 
[23:34:03] cronin: there might be something wrong with my browser
[23:34:12] AmyTS: OGS is populated with Ents.  they take a long time to mourn.
[23:34:25] LinuxGooo: Ents ??? 
[23:34:40] PEPFAR: trees
[23:34:47] AmyTS: the talking trees from Lord of the Rings.  they take all morning to say hello.
[23:34:55] Muttley: What browser are you using?
[23:35:00] cronin: all of them
[23:35:09] LinuxGooo: aha .... 
[23:35:10] cronin: i checked from mobile - same story
[23:35:12] Muttley: Have you tried Netscape?
[23:35:14] domie: what brother are you using ?*
[23:35:26] Muttley: That's the best with OGS
[23:35:28] AmyTS: use the older brother.
[23:35:33] Muttley: they haven't updated since 1990
[23:35:36] cronin: either I have been banned or this mourning thing might be true
[23:35:52] gghh: probably some server problem
[23:35:56] Muttley: Well, I'm here to kick butt or chew gum, and I'm all out of mourning
[23:35:57] cronin: given the propension to light trolling of the admins i wouldn't trust what they say
[23:36:00] Muttley: so it ain't that
[23:36:01] gghh: backend not responding
[23:36:14] Muttley: porbably a server problem at their end
[23:36:15] AmyTS: what time is it there muttley?  you're out of morning too.
[23:36:25] Muttley: kadum tssch
[23:36:49] Muttley: you know you can check whether sites are accepting connections on the internet
[23:36:58] cronin: yes
[23:37:39] Muttley: you have your answer in that case
[23:37:59] cronin: uhm, M-W says "propension" is archaic and i should use "propensity" instead
[23:38:16] AmyTS: i popped open the dev tools for OGS and didn't see any failed XHR or WS requests.  it all looks normal.  just empty.
[23:38:24] zikego: On OGS for mea culpa, you have some good work on the new josekis from AI
[23:38:37] AmyTS: the site is a fully functional ghost town
[23:38:51] rarara: OGS is down :(
[23:38:55] rarara: Code blue!  Code blue!
[23:39:05] zikego: Search in the puzzles
[23:39:12] cronin: it's lowkey annoying that admins, aside from their light trolling, have also this kind of "i know more than u" superiority aura, as if somebody asking a question necessarily is also an ingenue in all other regards
[23:39:44] cronin: thanks Amy
[23:39:45] zikego: cronin admin! lets move
[23:40:00] rarara: What's even worse is when Guests make amazing insightful comments.
[23:40:46] Muttley: You can't try to help some people without them taking offence, no matter what you do :))
[23:40:49] Muttley: lesson learned.
[23:40:59] zikego: I m sure should get bored to stay admin all time
[23:41:14] Agronski: Tone, Muttley. Tone.
[23:41:30] Muttley: I'm using the bridge pick up
[23:41:41] Agronski: Put it back down, then.
[23:42:22] AmyTS: Increase the tone by 20 hz.
[23:42:44] Agronski: Hmm.
[23:42:48] Agronski: </pun>
[23:48:15] Ryukai: That's a strong ish, if anyone is looking.
[23:49:35] rarara: I am sad, is OGS broken for good, or is it just today?
[23:51:32] Wrenn: In what way is OGS broken? Only thing I see wrong is the indicator for how many games it is your move in did not appear.
[23:51:52] rarara: there are 0 games being played
[23:51:52] AmyTS: I see no games, no chat, no logged-in users.
[23:52:04] cronin: me too :(
[23:52:28] cronin: some days ago there was a major screw-up by one of the main coders
[23:52:35] cronin: that terminated a ton of games
[23:52:40] cronin: maybe they're at it again
[23:53:01] zikego: you can see some OGS blitz in the corona room
[23:53:58] AmyTS: i see chat and logged in users now.
[23:54:13] AmyTS: and games.
[23:55:12] cronin: wow, indeed!" they're back with a vengeance!
[23:56:33] zico: the cases of COVID-19 in the US almost reached a million, while the second country with the most COVID-19 is Spain with a little bit over 200 thousand. I guess the US does really want to be number one at everything
[23:56:57] zikego: @Amy+1
[23:57:08] Wrenn: (zico, without giving per capita numbers, that statistic is pointless :P)
[23:58:05] cronin: i thought this was a virus free room
[23:58:40] rarara: Yes, but USA is actually believable in counting
[23:59:03] rarara: we did it!  We keep KGS running, and now we saved OGS too!
[23:59:20] cronin: *high fives*
[00:01:29] AmyTS: *socially-distant elbow bump*
[00:02:00] Jordan111: uggg how long must we continue to social distance ?
[00:02:28] Agronski: About 2 meters.
[00:02:32] Agronski: </pun>
[00:03:42] ericj: ha, good one, Agronski
[00:03:47] Jordan111: ko fight.
[00:04:24] Jordan111: Go fight. 
[00:42:15] zxsteven10: go fight
[00:49:59] FightorDie: we are at start, not end
[00:50:23] FightorDie: of  pandemie-....
[00:52:11] OoooWeee: fill in the blank?
[00:52:30] OoooWeee: Merkel
[00:53:48] Epsilion: hi pals\
[01:01:14] ericj: hi Epsilion
[01:08:04] AmyTS: main screen turn on
[01:08:29] rarara: i knew a pro who was very weak at ko...
[01:08:38] rarara: he retired from Go after losing a big game
[01:09:14] Agronski: </All your base meme>
