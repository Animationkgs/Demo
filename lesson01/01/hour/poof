[07:39:42] zerocool: I'm no better for facts than the tourist who happened to snap a picture
[07:41:12] zerocool: I am at ground zero, and I see the chaos, but my expertiese is networking, not medical stuffs, but the stuff even I see knowing nothing *eyeroll*
[07:45:37] zerocool: there are a lot of anxios college students wanting to be a part of something BIG, I'm in the ER, I'm in the ICU, I remember being young and excited, but yea, there is something wrong about that
[08:00:44] TengenBot: Now on store shelves everywhere: TengenBot souveniers! This set includes a number of TengenBots (not Tengen Monsters, which are very different, and I don't know why) plus a ridiculously useful (and easy to use!) store centipede that comes with six common tools! Now you can easily store, move, and reinforce your tools all at the same time!
[08:07:27] LinuxGooo: wish you all a good night. On the way to take a nap. See you guys. :-)

[12:19:15] ApplePie: Disney channel
[12:21:14] meyerX: i want applepie
[12:23:43] ApplePie: me too
[12:24:41] ApplePie: they ran out of pies in costco
[12:24:46] ApplePie: my heart is broken
[12:24:52] meyerX: let's go to walmart
[12:25:02] ApplePie: do they sell pies in walmart?
[12:25:08] meyerX: maybe
[12:25:12] meyerX: you have to find out
[12:25:13] ApplePie: ok
[12:26:23] meyerX: have you downloaded their app?
[12:26:42] ApplePie: no I haven't
[12:26:48] ApplePie: I probably should
[12:27:08] ApplePie: I usually just go to costco, food4less and 99 ranch
[12:27:53] ApplePie: because I can only afford cheap groceries
[12:27:57] ApplePie: and I love asian food
[12:28:40] meyerX: i love sushi and ramen
[12:28:51] ApplePie: Nice
[12:28:54] ApplePie: me too
[12:29:11] meyerX: but my local walmart stops providing them
[12:29:13] meyerX: i'm mad
[12:29:30] ApplePie: dang
[12:30:29] ApplePie: try some other supermarkets
[12:31:53] meyerX: and my favourite sushi restaurant in town does not  offer takeaway
[12:31:59] meyerX: i'm mad *2

[17:42:38] highhand: harukunn has game in pandorarengo room, need 2
[17:42:59] highhand: rengo game is a 4 person game, not everyone knows this
[17:50:56] Chris: that is factually incorrect. rengo is a 3 person game of waiting for a fourth
[17:51:09] Kingu: lol
[17:53:19] cronin: XD
[17:53:33] domie: lol
[18:05:15] Kingu: aka “the Beckett game”
[18:06:16] MrPanda: anything interesting going on ?
[18:06:30] Kingu: a mortal disease
[18:08:13] MrPanda: lol
[18:33:28] XY0908: Good morning.
[18:33:43] ummjhall: good evening
[18:33:45] XY0908: What's GoUniverse please?
[18:36:19] XY0908: Ok, I have more interesting question: Is English Muffin actually originated from England? Or is it used as French in French Fries?
[18:38:38] cronin: Hi
[18:39:31] cronin: GoUniverse is the awesome chrome extension that offers a client to kgs
[18:39:41] cronin: Written by kocmohabt
[18:39:58] Agronski: Think "English Muffin" is used to distinguish them from US "muffins" which are more like cupcakes. Whether or not they originate from England isn't really important.
[18:41:49] XY0908: Thanks both. Agronski, hope you are not acting like a teacher I had when I was in elementary school, sixty years ago.
[18:42:37] rarara: The Lyre bird pretends to be other birds and can imitate their singing.
[18:47:23] Agronski: Acting how?
[18:50:28] XY0908: there was a teacher, an old man, who would say "It's not important." when we, 7 year old children, asked questions and he didn't know the answers.
[18:51:10] XY0908: You know, 7 years could have many unexpected questions.
[18:52:15] Chris: that's at least better than making stuff up like we should inject ourselves with lysol to prevent covid
[18:52:18] XY0908: full of wonderful ideas and totally curious about everything.
[18:52:32] Agronski: Ah, so. Well, no - not doing that. Just meant the origin doesn't factor into the naming any more - as you noted, French Fries aren't even French xD
[18:52:45] anjarubik: hmmm something wrong with my client
[18:53:14] XY0908: Chris, absolutely. He also suggested beaming organs with UV.
[18:53:42] XY0908: I know Agro, I was just pulling your leg. :-)
[18:53:48] highhand: Chris (rengo is 3 person waiting game) partly true, but once game starts, usually it creates a game that is good for review
[18:53:58] highhand: now we need 1 more for rengo
[18:54:03] highhand: pandorarengo room
[18:54:06] anjarubik: anyone experience chat overflow? the player names in the chat disappear to the left after long time of inactivity
[18:54:23] XY0908: highhand, I bet domie is a part of the team.
[18:54:31] Chris: I have a better question. Does the name Agronski imply that there are other gronskis?
[18:54:43] kindred: anjarubik, that happens when someone pastes in a very long link
[18:54:55] kindred: then everything in the chat gets shifted to left
[18:55:02] XY0908: remedy: restart the client.
[18:55:17] kindred: or close this room, and re-enter it
[18:55:27] anjarubik: resize the window is ok
[18:55:28] XY0908: or, that.

[19:47:47] puffy: puff on
[19:55:05] Epsilion: hi puff
[19:55:15] Ryukai: What does huff mean?
[19:55:56] Epsilion: it's like a somewhat passively-agressive exhalation
[19:55:59] zico: huff is the sound you make when you breathe out heavily and loudly
[19:58:23] rarara: huff is a derogatory term for someone who is a member of the Wizard Hufflepuff
[19:58:28] Ryukai: So the big bad wolf huffs, and puffs, and blows.  How's he retain consciousness if he only breaths out?
[19:59:13] VIXX: and this room regularly resembles a huff
[19:59:15] VIXX: :)
[20:02:56] Warfreak2: i guess "puff" was already taken as a derogatory term
[20:03:24] Ryukai: Ghostbusters fans?
[20:04:56] Warfreak2: 12. (derogatory, slang, Britain, particularly northern UK) Synonym of poof: a male homosexual, especially an effeminate one.
[20:07:43] TengenBot: Help, I'm the new Prime Minister and I don't know anything about leading a country! Or how to negotiate with other countries? Or how to pay for the government I've started to implement, just so that I can make sure that I win a majority and don't lose it when the global economy tanked on my watch because I spent money on things I should have spent money on?
[20:10:30] AmyTS: I miss dsaun.
[20:14:15] zico: I miss him too
[20:14:15] cronin: We all do.
[20:14:26] Ryukai: ^
[20:19:59] cekalo: is it true that vultures are flying around in new york?
[20:20:39] XY0908: this is how the rumor starts?
[20:21:06] Ryukai: Is it mean to make fun of lawyers?
[20:21:09] XY0908: how rumors start*
[20:21:26] XY0908: vultures don't eat sharks.
[20:22:08] cekalo: they are atrected by smell of dead bodies
[20:37:36] BrandonMLG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvOLb9LKOoA
[20:43:03] Epsilion: they've been there for a while now cekalo, they're called wall street speculators
[20:43:47] alfalfa: vulture capitalists
[20:45:41] dayharri: it is called "Steeeve Maaadden".
[20:59:11] cronin: Bloody bitcoin hoarders
[21:02:19] Agronski: Even less useful than money hoarders - at least you can use dollars as toilet paper, or vice-versa, depending on the economy.
[21:08:02] puffy: i perfer to use 100's
[21:39:25] XY0908: Good morning, good sir Herod.
[21:40:02] Soromon: hey XY. Looked at your album - I liked the one near the end with the tree
[21:40:50] Soromon: I forget the name - two words
[21:43:46] XY0908: a winter tree, or afternoon walking?
[21:44:00] XY0908: Thank you for viewing.
[21:45:41] Soromon: afternoon walking
[21:47:17] ericj: Hi, everyone
[21:47:19] XY0908: Thank you. It's a real landscape since the lock down.
[21:47:31] XY0908: hello good sir, ericj.
[21:47:44] ericj: and to you, XY
[21:48:58] arndt: maybe I should go see if the local Korean restaurant is open
[21:49:01] zico: is there any dentist here?
[21:49:09] arndt: mine is sick
[21:50:05] highhand: are dentists still working?
[21:50:28] highhand: their work generate lots of aerosol
[21:50:32] kindred: probably, for emergencies at least
[21:51:38] zico: I bit something too hard, and one of my tooth chipped. I wonder whether I should do dental filling and how much does it usually cost
[21:51:39] highhand: what kind of emergencies exist, besides injury?
[21:52:48] highhand: inquiry as in car accidents, else all can defer for 6 months to a year?
[21:53:12] XY0908: ouch, zico. should see a doctor quickly under the circumcetance- don't delay, because the problem will get bigger.
[21:53:12] kindred: a molar tooth can break if you bite on something
[21:54:00] highhand: losing a tooth is real bad, but not life threatening, maybe some kind of dental infections are emergencies
[21:54:14] Ryukai: So an apple a day might keep the doctor away, but the dentist will be lurking around the corner?
[21:54:14] zico: yeah, mine is molar, and it chipped into a big cavity. sometimes when I eat, things slip into the cavity, and it's troublesome to pick it out with toothpick everytime I eat
[21:54:26] kindred: have you had it happen, highhand? it becomes difficult to eat something
[21:55:06] arndt: I'm in the process of having a tooth fixed
[21:55:13] highhand: I do not know. I certainly have big gaps everywhere, teeth, brain, etc
[21:55:16] arndt: it's stable but needs another visit
[21:55:18] XY0908: McMaster is on! Good! What a relief!
[21:55:26] arndt: the dentist had a plastic mask
[21:55:36] arndt: or what the word is
[21:56:31] zico: face schield?
[21:56:52] XY0908: ski mask?
[21:57:05] zico: I mean *face shield
[21:57:16] arndt: not ski mask, a more like shield
[21:57:21] XY0908: :-)
[21:57:23] highhand: space helmet
[21:57:25] zico: ski mask?? XY, dentists are not robbers
[21:57:35] XY0908: they are, zico.
[21:57:43] XY0908: look at the bills.
[21:57:50] zico: well, you're right. haha
[21:57:56] highhand: a reaper mask
[21:58:04] XY0908: (that's why I said ski mask)
[21:58:25] XY0908: 30 minutes of cleaning= $185
[21:58:37] highhand: are there lots of lawsuits against dentists? that drive up costs
[21:58:39] zico: but, the bills come with the costs. the dental equipments are so expensive
[21:59:20] XY0908: you are willing to pay $60 for a cookie because the baking equipment is expensive?
[21:59:36] JIeBuc: some peopel do
[21:59:46] XY0908: O_O
[21:59:56] zico: that's why I want to know whether there are denstists here or not. Maybe they can explain why it's so expensive
[22:00:08] Ryukai: Some of us can make a -really- good cookie.
[22:00:22] JIeBuc: I think material+equipment+salary
[22:00:38] XY0908: what about the time?
[22:00:52] JIeBuc: for example, 100$ for 5-minute consultation with a doctor is expensive or not?
[22:01:08] XY0908: Expensive, of course.
[22:01:18] zico: for me, that's expensive but, it is partially covered by insurance
[22:01:18] JIeBuc: But that's usually around that price
[22:01:27] JIeBuc: 50-100$
[22:01:49] JIeBuc: and it's price just for time and education
[22:02:02] JIeBuc: if we add material, it becomes even more
[22:02:05] XY0908: wheather it's covered or not, it's still expensive. At the end it's US who will pay for the insurance cost.
[22:02:34] Agronski: Big Tooth doesn't want you to fix your own teeth with polymer repair kits from Amazon. That and the Tooth Fairy Mafia.
[22:02:37] highhand: $100 for a 5min consultation is cheap, if that results in a life changing attitude shift
[22:03:33] zico: lol. that's funny, hh
[22:04:02] XY0908: I wonder how many doctors give a hoot about Hippocratic Oath these days.
[22:04:13] JIeBuc: for many people price depends not on spent time, but overall amount of clients
[22:04:25] ericj: The vast majority, XY
[22:04:36] XY0908: really?
[22:04:39] JIeBuc: if person wants to have 200$ day and has only 2 clients, then it's going to be 100$
[22:04:44] Ryukai: Doctors are typically good people with greedy bosses.
[22:04:45] ericj: I spoke with one last night, in fact, and he definitely does.
[22:04:46] zikego: teeth are like shoes or cars they show your social level.
[22:05:10] ericj: He works with aging folks in the southwest of Wyoming. Has been working really really hard to maintain his facilities covid-free. Really good guy.
[22:05:19] zikego: So theyy are expensive
[22:05:20] arndt: once there was a doctor examining me for a health insurance, paid by my company, and his role seemed to be to identify areas which the insurance wouldn't cover
[22:05:23] highhand: I hope its more than you think. People went thru a lot for that training. If they have a certain mentality it helped them make it to the end
[22:05:26] ericj: In fact, all the doctors I know are typically very caring people.
[22:05:42] XY0908: ericj, I think you're confused it with being Hypocrisy
[22:05:46] arndt: the company then chose another insurance
[22:06:11] ericj: XY, not at all. I have not met any like that. A few that I felt were arrogant, but still, caring and skilled.
[22:06:34] XY0908: You win. And stop being so series.
[22:06:46] bert: i go with eric on this
[22:06:50] JIeBuc: But I agree dentists are expensive
[22:06:53] Ryukai: With the amount of sheer time and effort required to become a doctor, it's perfectly fair to be a bit smug you accomplished it.  xD
[22:07:07] XY0908: In my experience, 60% of doctors care more about money.
[22:07:44] Ryukai: Not the doctor's fault for the most part though.
[22:07:48] XY0908: 90% in lawyers.
[22:07:52] zikego: and 90% of ppl too
[22:07:53] ericj: I know, Ryukai. The most arrogant I met was the guy who fixed my knee. "It's gonna be better than before!" etc :)
[22:08:00] JIeBuc: In my country doctors have one of the lowest salaries
[22:08:13] ericj: I recall thinking two things: 1) I want you to be the one who does this surgery, and 2) I'm glad we're not friends hahahaha
[22:08:18] zico: don't tell me you're in Cuba, JleBuc
[22:08:22] JIeBuc: nope
[22:08:48] ericj: Here it's so high because the system is so messed up. A doctor's malpractice insurance can run several hundred thousand a year.
[22:08:50] XY0908: teachers are the ones who get paid the least in most countries.
[22:08:54] Ryukai: It isn't the doctor who decides the price of treatment, they're just the guy who tells you you're gonna need it.  xD
[22:08:57] JIeBuc: so basically anyone who went to work as doctor just a kind person, who wants to help
[22:09:18] highhand: in PRC doctors sometimes become victims of violence, from family of patients
[22:09:27] zikego: From what i hear from medias medical staff are suffering a bit for money,means... in western countries
[22:09:39] Ryukai: You can always choose to sell cheap, but you can't always choose to buy cheap.
[22:09:44] highhand: I do not think the average doctor there is that highly paid
[22:10:08] zikego: France, Spain Prtugal at least but ididnt check thers
[22:10:26] zikego: others
[22:10:54] XY0908: I think doctors fee differ greatly by countries. I read it somewhere the same knee surgery costs 6 times higher in the US than Sweden.
[22:11:13] ericj: it's our insurance system + litigiousness :-/
[22:11:19] Ryukai: Capitalism is fun.
[22:11:25] ericj: mine was in 2009 and they billed the insurance company $24,000
[22:11:26] XY0908: yes, eric.
[22:12:04] zikego: And many times doctors just cant solve problems inducing the bad health (wars, poverty,...)
[22:12:17] XY0908: Mine was about $8,500 for torn meniscus surgery.
[22:12:22] bert: of course, dentists are a completely different case
[22:12:30] Ryukai: Doctor's fees essentially come down to what they have to pay to operate.  Being affordable often means they're bleeding funds.
[22:12:36] ericj: a repair, XY, or a partial meniscotomy?
[22:12:44] JIeBuc: isn't that a kind of fraud?
[22:12:46] ericj: (cutting off / cleaning up)
[22:12:50] XY0908: All dentists should watch Little Shop of Horror.
[22:12:58] Ryukai: Please no.
[22:13:01] ericj: Feed me, Seymour! :)
[22:13:05] XY0908: cutting off, then stapled.
[22:13:14] highhand: US institutions for medical services are atrocious. Europe seem to overdo it in the other extreme. France, for example?
[22:13:15] Ryukai: Needles are scary enough.  Don't give them more ideas.
[22:13:29] XY0908: or, Marathon Man
[22:13:58] ericj: Gotcha, XY. Mine was repairable, so I had meniscus repair + acl reconstruction
[22:14:15] XY0908: that costed $24,000?
[22:14:29] Xorax: US is weird... having to pay for stuff like insulin should be a crime xD
[22:14:30] XY0908: including the rehab?
[22:14:58] zikego: England has one of most expensive policy ppl contribute a loy to the healthcare, highland
[22:15:03] ericj: Well, they billed 24k for it. The rehab took 18 sessions of PT at about 150 a pop? but through a different provider
[22:15:28] zikego: more as in France ithink
[22:15:35] XY0908: The rehab costed a lot for me.
[22:17:01] XY0908: and in the end, I didn't feel much difference.
[22:17:28] highhand: UK is very unEuropean, thats the impression I get from far away.
[22:17:37] XY0908: The insurance denied after few sessions so I had to pay out of pocket
[22:18:10] XY0908: highhand, that's why Brexit
[22:18:11] Muttley: zikego, you got a reference for that?
[22:18:49] ericj: that's weird, xy, and very strange. my rehab was extremely effective, got me from unable to move the leg to full function in those 18 sessions, I mean, playing soccer again full function
[22:19:03] Muttley: It's a country with universal healthcare that is funded out of taxation :))
[22:19:27] XY0908: ericj, I think it has to do with the age.
[22:19:30] ericj: I agree with you, Xorax.
[22:19:40] ericj: Could be, XY :)
[22:20:15] XY0908: they should charge nothing for insulin, but charge 10 times more for Botox.
[22:20:33] Ryukai: Just start charging a tax for using literally incorrectly.
[22:20:37] ericj: Botox is already sold close to price, and largely not covered by insurance, XY
[22:20:37] XY0908: Botox for cosmetic purpose.
[22:20:48] rubicon: That would literally be tax fraud
[22:21:56] XY0908: rubicon
[22:22:06] XY0908: any chance for season 2?
[22:22:39] XY0908: (sorry- I couldn't help)
[22:23:46] XY0908: ericj, again on the rehab, maybe also I wasn't diligent enough with the follow up.
[22:24:04] XY0908: <--- hates exercise
[22:24:11] ericj: well, if you quit after just a couple sessions, that would be very bad.
[22:24:24] XY0908: I did about 30 sessions.
[22:24:37] ericj: I mean, at the end, I would lie on my stomach with a rope around my foot, pulling it very hard to increase range of motion
[22:24:39] XY0908: but my mind was somewhere else.
[22:25:51] XY0908: time to eat. bye guys.
[22:25:55] ericj: later!
[22:25:59] XY0908: and girls.
[22:27:13] JIeBuc: there are no girls on kgs
[22:28:10] PEPFAR: only FBI agents
[22:28:18] Muttley: zsi for a start, J
[22:28:23] Muttley: only a pro :)
[22:28:38] Muttley: Who is actually online now :D
[22:28:48] Ryukai: 50/50
[22:29:33] Muttley: Anyway, I'm going to see how I fare taking 40 stones against cheater.  Could be a long game.
[22:29:40] Muttley: I lost.
[22:29:57] Ryukai: Close.
[22:30:18] Muttley: I was doing OK placing te handicap stones
[22:30:25] Muttley: things went downhill after that.
[22:30:57] Ryukai: At least your first 40 stones were alright.
[22:31:54] Ryukai: He's just sitting there.
[22:31:56] Ryukai: Menacingly.
[22:36:34] zikego: Dont be so shy, some of my best memories were playing a game with a pro
[22:37:29] Ryukai: Wait what.
[22:37:32] zikego: its like playing with a book alive, how wonderful their moves
[22:37:44] Ryukai: Who are we talking about?
[22:38:09] zikego: cheater
[22:38:15] Ryukai: Oic.
[22:38:47] Ryukai: Sneaky pros.
[22:39:13] Ryukai: *Menace Intensifies*
[22:59:35] domie: a fourth 3k-7d in Kurohata RENGO ?
[23:03:32] Ryukai: Woah, that was a lot of us just lurking.
[23:04:21] Muttley: Flushdraw 9d - Cheater, people :D
[23:10:13] AmyTS: warble
[23:12:22] cronin: g'evening
[23:19:31] Ryukai: Yello'.
[23:25:58] cronin: is there a pro review room?
[23:26:36] mongo: i think so
[23:26:47] mongo: a teacher room..
[23:27:06] cronin: *mystery intensifies*
[23:27:55] LinuxGooo: hello ... g`d evening
[23:28:46] cronin: can I ask an OGS question here?
[23:29:00] cronin: (where is everyone?)
[23:29:00] bolbi: why not?
[23:29:47] mongo: you mean the server that cannot be named?
[23:30:02] AmyTS: oh no
[23:30:21] zikego: so?
[23:30:22] LinuxGooo: pst... dont speak it out loudly, mongo. OGS may not be named on KGS. Dont name it. :-)
[23:30:35] cronin: you see it too? :(
[23:30:42] AmyTS: See what?
[23:30:48] cronin: the nothingness
[23:30:52] cronin: no games being played, etc
[23:30:55] AmyTS: On OGS?  Yes.
[23:31:18] cronin: is that normal?
[23:31:29] zikego: lot of correspondance games
[23:31:30] AmyTS: dunno, i hadn't logged in since 2015.
[23:31:37] cronin: ohh
[23:31:45] zikego: like 1 move 3 days
[23:31:56] zikego: or a week depends
[23:32:08] Muttley: cronin, OGS is having a day of mourning today
[23:32:19] Muttley: because Go Seigen died.
[23:32:27] Muttley: news travels slowly on OGS
[23:32:56] rarara: OGS is not succesful?  There is only one reason.
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: what ???? :-)
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: The OGS Nirwana
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: correspondence games had been always majority on OGS. Very normal.
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: hm ... but thats long time ago. :-)
[23:33:44] LinuxGooo: I mean, its long time gone when Go Seigen died. OGS folks are little bit late to mourn now. :-)
[23:34:03] cronin: there might be something wrong with my browser
[23:34:12] AmyTS: OGS is populated with Ents.  they take a long time to mourn.
[23:34:25] LinuxGooo: Ents ???
[23:34:40] PEPFAR: trees
[23:34:47] AmyTS: the talking trees from Lord of the Rings.  they take all morning to say hello.
[23:34:55] Muttley: What browser are you using?
[23:35:00] cronin: all of them
[23:35:09] LinuxGooo: aha ....
[23:35:10] cronin: i checked from mobile - same story
[23:35:12] Muttley: Have you tried Netscape?
[23:35:14] domie: what brother are you using ?*
[23:35:26] Muttley: That's the best with OGS
[23:35:28] AmyTS: use the older brother.
[23:35:33] Muttley: they haven't updated since 1990
[23:35:36] cronin: either I have been banned or this mourning thing might be true
[23:35:52] gghh: probably some server problem
[23:35:56] Muttley: Well, I'm here to kick butt or chew gum, and I'm all out of mourning
[23:35:57] cronin: given the propension to light trolling of the admins i wouldn't trust what they say
[23:36:00] Muttley: so it ain't that
[23:36:01] gghh: backend not responding
[23:36:14] Muttley: porbably a server problem at their end
[23:36:15] AmyTS: what time is it there muttley?  you're out of morning too.
[23:36:25] Muttley: kadum tssch
[23:36:49] Muttley: you know you can check whether sites are accepting connections on the internet
[23:36:58] cronin: yes
[23:37:39] Muttley: you have your answer in that case
[23:37:59] cronin: uhm, M-W says "propension" is archaic and i should use "propensity" instead
[23:38:16] AmyTS: i popped open the dev tools for OGS and didn't see any failed XHR or WS requests.  it all looks normal.  just empty.
[23:38:24] zikego: On OGS for mea culpa, you have some good work on the new josekis from AI
[23:38:37] AmyTS: the site is a fully functional ghost town
[23:38:51] rarara: OGS is down :(
[23:38:55] rarara: Code blue!  Code blue!
[23:39:05] zikego: Search in the puzzles
[23:39:12] cronin: it's lowkey annoying that admins, aside from their light trolling, have also this kind of "i know more than u" superiority aura, as if somebody asking a question necessarily is also an ingenue in all other regards
[23:39:44] cronin: thanks Amy
[23:39:45] zikego: cronin admin! lets move
[23:40:00] rarara: What's even worse is when Guests make amazing insightful comments.
[23:40:46] Muttley: You can't try to help some people without them taking offence, no matter what you do :))
[23:40:49] Muttley: lesson learned.
[23:40:59] zikego: I m sure should get bored to stay admin all time
[23:41:14] Agronski: Tone, Muttley. Tone.
[23:41:30] Muttley: I'm using the bridge pick up
[23:41:41] Agronski: Put it back down, then.
[23:42:22] AmyTS: Increase the tone by 20 hz.
[23:42:44] Agronski: Hmm.
[23:42:48] Agronski: </pun>
[23:48:15] Ryukai: That's a strong ish, if anyone is looking.
[23:49:35] rarara: I am sad, is OGS broken for good, or is it just today?
[23:51:32] Wrenn: In what way is OGS broken? Only thing I see wrong is the indicator for how many games it is your move in did not appear.
[23:51:52] rarara: there are 0 games being played
[23:51:52] AmyTS: I see no games, no chat, no logged-in users.
[23:52:04] cronin: me too :(
[23:52:28] cronin: some days ago there was a major screw-up by one of the main coders
[23:52:35] cronin: that terminated a ton of games
[23:52:40] cronin: maybe they're at it again
[23:53:01] zikego: you can see some OGS blitz in the corona room
[23:53:58] AmyTS: i see chat and logged in users now.
[23:54:13] AmyTS: and games.
[23:55:12] cronin: wow, indeed!" they're back with a vengeance!
[23:56:33] zico: the cases of COVID-19 in the US almost reached a million, while the second country with the most COVID-19 is Spain with a little bit over 200 thousand. I guess the US does really want to be number one at everything
[23:56:57] zikego: @Amy+1
[23:57:08] Wrenn: (zico, without giving per capita numbers, that statistic is pointless :P)
[23:58:05] cronin: i thought this was a virus free room
[23:58:40] rarara: Yes, but USA is actually believable in counting
[23:59:03] rarara: we did it!  We keep KGS running, and now we saved OGS too!
[23:59:20] cronin: *high fives*
[00:01:29] AmyTS: *socially-distant elbow bump*
[00:02:00] Jordan111: uggg how long must we continue to social distance ?
[00:02:28] Agronski: About 2 meters.
[00:02:32] Agronski: </pun>
[00:03:42] ericj: ha, good one, Agronski
[00:03:47] Jordan111: ko fight.
[00:04:24] Jordan111: Go fight.
[00:42:15] zxsteven10: go fight
[00:49:59] FightorDie: we are at start, not end

[01:01:14] ericj: hi Epsilion
[01:08:04] AmyTS: main screen turn on
[01:08:29] rarara: i knew a pro who was very weak at ko...
[01:08:38] rarara: he retired from Go after losing a big game
[01:09:14] Agronski: </All your base meme>
[01:18:48] zikego: who?
[01:23:29] McMaster: joe
[01:23:42] zxsteven10: how
[01:24:30] Lasciel: does anyone know if Shin Jinseo won his game today?
[01:41:57] Lambic12: he did
[01:43:41] grout: kghin is back!
[01:44:33] McMaster: welcome back
[01:44:58] grout: will we see bigbadwolf again, too?
[01:47:44] decros: anyone for a 1:00:00+3x0:30 game?
[02:23:56] bbijc: meow
[02:31:43] TengenBot: ¿Dónde está incautado a la atención de este incidente? Ha sido tener cinco prime y existe de la situación dirección para el carístico último de índice.
[02:32:20] PEPFAR: the bot is finally making sense
[02:33:53] grout: they must be fixing the troll-bot's bridge. who let it out?
[02:39:22] TengenBot: The bridge was under construction in Southern France by the Pirate party of France (FPOF) and had been stolen by TengenBot and transported to the dimension of Fantasyland. As long as it's in the land, TengenBot will never lose it again.
[03:07:01] BrandonMLG: hey erijc
[03:07:28] BrandonMLG: Uh i think my rank glitched
[03:07:42] mongo: that happens
[03:08:12] BrandonMLG: cuz i played a game i won but i leveld up 4 times
[03:09:25] mongo: oh, yur rank has a ?
[03:09:31] mongo: in that case its normal..
[03:09:55] Now: I want the same
[03:09:57] mongo: not enough games for the ranking system to stablize your rank
[03:10:03] Now: tired of being 4k
[03:10:26] BrandonMLG: im suppose to be 14k but i somehow levled to 8k then i played a game and then i leveld to 4k...
[03:10:35] Now: my games are or too easy or too smashed
[03:10:39] BrandonMLG: and my teacher is 5k....
[03:10:53] mongo: :O
[03:10:58] alfalfa: well, you know the proverb, "play your first one-hundred games silently"
[03:11:09] BrandonMLG: if my teacher sees my rank
[03:11:16] BrandonMLG: hes gonna be suprised
[03:12:26] mongo: even with out the ? the system recalculates based on changes in recents opponents i think
[03:12:58] mongo: and it also sometime applies "corrections" across the board
[03:13:02] Chris: it's because you have a win against a rated opponent, all your losses are against "?"
[03:13:21] Hu: Howdy folks
[03:13:39] mongo: howdy pard'
[03:13:39] Chris: play solid rated people and it will sort out quickly
[03:13:44] Chris: hi hu
[03:13:48] Hu: Hi mongo
[03:13:54] Hu: Chris
[03:13:56] mongo: o/
[03:14:01] Now: I am solid 4k Brandon, wanna smash?
[03:17:42] BrandonMLG: NO
[03:18:13] BrandonMLG: chris can you go tell erijc about my rank thingy
[03:19:14] ericj: Um, Brandon, you ignored my reply to your PM
[03:19:43] ericj: And these guys are right about it. Nobody pulled a lever, it's making its best guess
[03:20:07] alfalfa: "play your first one-hundred games silently"
[03:21:48] Epsilion: thank the lord for whiskey
[03:22:54] alfalfa: praise jesus!
[03:23:08] Epsilion: hallelujah
[03:23:21] mongo: And now she's walking out the door
[03:24:17] alfalfa: like she did a thousand times before?
[03:24:36] mongo: thats a lot of whiskey..

[03:54:57] Now: hi bb
[03:55:16] Now: no problem. Need something?
[03:55:21] Now: I am always willing to help
[03:55:33] TengenBot: I thought the Jedi were forbidden to drink after the Battle of the Naboo?
[03:55:56] bbll2013: what is the 16th letter in the a
[03:56:07] bbll2013: you know
[03:56:23] bbll2013: the ABC

[03:57:44] bbll2013: o
[03:58:11] Now: I have no idea of what you mean
[03:58:46] rarara: When Isaac Newton went on quarantine, he invented Calculus.
[03:58:58] rarara: Hopefully, after this quarantine, we will invent Quantum Computers.
[03:58:59] Epsilion: abcdef
[03:59:06] bbll2013: it is pokeymon
[03:59:42] Epsilion: they're already invented dingdong

[04:01:27] Now: are you an introvert?
[04:01:30] bggo: The answer is P
[04:01:46] bbll2013: now do you under stand
[04:02:03] Soromon: Forbidden to drink?
[04:02:44] Now: I don´t understand you
[04:02:47] TengenBot: Yes, all living beings must adhere to the laws of their homeworld and, for the Jedi, it was necessary to stay away from any kind of liquids until the other galaxy had recovered from the shock of the end of the Clone Wars.
[04:03:19] Herod: If you have nothing to say there is no need to say it
[04:03:21] Soromon: Ah. The Sith will do all the drinking then.
[04:03:51] fly: Herod: I presume that was not meant to be self-referential?
[04:04:23] Epsilion: yeah shutup h-rod
[04:04:33] bggo: How do u become an admin on KGS?
[04:05:12] fly: You have to be tireless and have a huge amount of energy, and be willing to invest it!
[04:05:23] AEK: you must apply. (:
[04:05:29] TengenBot: The Sith Dark Council is small and unorganized, but we know there are many who enjoy it.
[04:05:30] ErikaKohut: Free course ....just a $30.00 registration fee
[04:06:08] kindred: oh, they're smaller than i thought
[04:07:25] Now: ñ
[04:11:45] TengenBot: The dark side of the go board is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. Psychic senses, communication with spirits, and more were all known to be able to be gained by becoming a pro player.
[04:12:53] rarara: Yes, Hikaru became a pro and communicated with this ancient ghost, Sai.
[04:14:22] TengenBot: Indeed. Through a cryptic line of text written by Sai on the board, Hikaru's strength of mind became bolstered. This allowed him to wield the Jedi powers that his Jedi Master had taught him, becoming a powerful Jedi Guardian. However, this power came at a price: his very will and sanity had been stretched to the breaking point.
[04:18:35] Falcon89: break him
[04:24:08] Muttley: Maybe if someone made him a nice cup of tea and a sandwich he'd feel better
[04:33:26] kyumaster: hi
[04:34:09] kyumaster: someone sent me a link to download tsumego. but it seems suspicious
[04:34:22] kyumaster: http://tsumegodojo.wordpress.com
[04:34:38] kyumaster: can anyone tell me, is it legit?
[04:35:12] Muttley: Wo sent it to you please
[04:35:19] Muttley: Who sent it to you please?
[04:36:00] kyumaster: do you know that person? username: shikifujin
[04:36:58] Muttley: was this in a pm just now?
[04:38:27] kyumaster: no, it was yesterday. is it scam link?
[04:39:09] Muttley: Correct me if I'm wrong, but yesterday was 25th April 2020
[04:39:20] Muttley: 24th April 2020 :)))
[04:39:36] Soromon: if yesterday was the 25th then I am in serious trouble
[04:39:58] Muttley: hehe
[04:40:05] Muttley: Yeah, looks like same person
[04:40:25] Muttley: kyumaster, you didn't use that account since March 30th
[04:41:27] kyumaster: oh, then it happen in other server. OGS
[04:41:35] ypkmhyo: come baby help me
[04:41:44] kyumaster: or tygem
[04:42:02] Hu: When making public accusations, it is best to get your facts straight first.
[04:43:19] Muttley: Kyumaster, very simple: stop posting your spam adverts trying to con people out of money by peddling illegal material you've copied
[04:43:24] Muttley: You
[04:43:31] Muttley: You've been banned for it before
[04:43:56] Muttley: Now you're back advertising it with a claim someone sent you the link yesterday, which is another false account
[04:44:01] kyumaster: but it sell nothing
[04:44:07] Muttley: off you go buddy
[04:44:11] kyumaster: all alrrady frer
[04:44:12] ypkmhyo: what was the material
[04:44:15] kyumaster: free
[04:45:40] Muttley: You've been banned before as kyuzero peddling the same material
[04:46:36] Gaijin: you should say that in BOLD :)
[04:46:51] Gaijin: flex ;)
[04:47:12] Muttley: shikifujin is one of his accounts
[04:47:57] alfalfa: so when he asks "is it a scam link?" he already knows the answer?  and the answer is "yes"?
[04:48:25] DeerTick: BigDog strikes again
[04:48:36] Gaijin: yeh - kinda like, does this outfit make me look fat
[04:48:38] Muttley: Yes, alfalfa
[04:49:13] Muttley: He's been banned for trying to selling illegally copied material, so his new way of doing it is to claim he was sent the link and wanted to check it#
[04:49:24] TengenBot: TengenBot will never scam you. He will never ask you for your email to submit a report for your money. TengenBot will never give any monetary compensation to you. This is the TengenBot Guarantee.
[04:49:28] Muttley: problem is, the account he claimed sent it to him is his own :))
[04:49:34] DeerTick: alfalfa, is that new picture you?
[04:49:54] alfalfa: why yes, deer, it is.
[04:50:22] alfalfa: i replace my picture every twenty years or so
[04:50:26] DeerTick: every twenty years
[04:50:41] Muttley: He got a haircut, DeerTick
[04:50:41] ypkmhyo: is there a way to search on kgs archive a game between 2 users without having to look month by month

[05:38:19] ypkmhyo: do you think he said what he said not trying to make (what he thinks is) a good suggestion but trying to harm people?
[05:38:21] Jordan111: Biggot vs no Biggot
[05:38:43] ypkmhyo: maybe some people believe trump is trying to harm people rather than just being scientific illiterate
[05:38:54] FightorDie: not  trust me pls...
[05:39:11] tomicus: I smoked pot once, maybe 7 times, but I inhaled, to this day I don't understand how Clinton screwed up *hic* such a simple concept
[05:39:12] highhand: ha, pandorarengo is a social room for all matters related to pandora, as well as rengo
[05:39:17] Jordan111: Trump is harmful when he just says one word..
[05:39:20] Chris: he said what he said to make himself look relevant and in charge of things
[05:39:33] highhand: someone opened the box and out come Trumps words :)
[05:39:38] ypkmhyo: that was certainly part of it chris
[05:39:41] Jordan111: Trump is a Dump
[05:39:49] PEPFAR: Or they believe fake news ypkmhyo
[05:39:49] FightorDie: hmm , we do but much forbidden  here?

[05:41:29] highhand: one fake news I heard was dry ice thing in a video, somewhere in Wuhan, back last year
[05:41:40] ypkmhyo: I think in trump's mind he made the connection - detergent kills virus, so why not use detergent to clean inside your body
[05:41:43] FightorDie: all that  ends in politic, or somthing
[05:41:48] ypkmhyo: it's actually not a bad question
[05:42:04] ypkmhyo: but he should not say what he said as the president
[05:42:07] Jordan111: You just reminded me of the spanice lady from family guy,
[05:42:17] highhand: that detergent is called white blood cells
[05:42:20] FightorDie: retalk

[05:57:26] heckki: how can Tomicus say the internet can never be shut down The government can  shut it down anytime they want
[05:57:27] FightorDie: , but can say now
[05:57:30] Jordan111: And now the Crona Virus, I think i have seen it all now.
[05:58:08] tomicus: OK, so *hic* you have NO idea what you are talking about, got it, do you even know what BGP is?
[05:58:08] Jordan111: Actually i think the goverment can do that.
[05:58:32] heckki: no what is BGP
[05:58:40] afgani: they shut down the internet in  iran
[05:58:46] Jordan111: Lol.
[05:59:05] Jordan111: I don't use videogames anymore.
[05:59:11] Jordan111: there stupid.
[05:59:21] gotime: KRATON
[05:59:26] Jordan111: Go is better.
[05:59:26] tomicus: Border Gateway Protocol, it's what the internet runs on, if you don't know that, you can't make the statement "the government can shut it down"
[05:59:50] Alex1234: shamu2
[05:59:55] Jordan111: Bro, the goverment has higherd hackers, and the pentagon,...
[06:00:10] Jordan111: they can shut down the internet anytime they want
[06:00:21] heckki: sure they just tell the ISPs to shut down and if they don't they send guys with guns and people who know how t urn off the few that down't comply
[06:00:27] afgani: only  god can shut  down the  internet
[06:00:50] Jordan111: are you on drugs afgani?
[06:01:05] tomicus: I'm with afgani, oddly, on most things
[06:01:07] Jordan111: i want to know what you are smoking
[06:01:09] afgani: not yet
[06:01:18] Jordan111: oh i see.
[06:01:26] tomicus: you do realise hackers built the *urp* internet?
[06:01:35] Jordan111: yes
[06:02:03] tomicus: well, "technically" they worked for DARPA, but who do you think they really were?
[06:02:07] alfalfa: it's hard to shut it down because it's designed to stay up
[06:02:20] Jordan111: I think it's possibal
[06:02:34] afgani: i guess they can block your access  to it
[06:02:46] alfalfa: if one part goes away another part takes its place
[06:02:47] Jordan111: sure, vary hard
[06:03:00] gorafiki: They can't shut down the whole internet but they can easily make it near enough inaccessible for the majority of their country's population
[06:03:05] heckki: the government  says turn off th e routers
[06:03:22] afgani: they shut it down  in  iran
[06:03:29] afgani: and in  egypt if i  remember correctly
[06:03:37] afgani: during the  arab spring
[06:03:42] heckki: the NSA monitors all the traffic so they can tll who is not complying
[06:03:44] tomicus: I hate agreeing with alf, sneakernet V2, a station wagon full of tapes
[06:04:14] afgani: if they shut down the  internet there would be  riots in the streets
[06:04:56] afgani: the internet has  become basically  an essential resource
[06:04:57] afgani: like water
[06:05:27] heckki: I'm just saying its possible   If they wanted to they could shut the electric grid
[06:05:51] tomicus: *hic* generators
[06:06:04] heckki: they bbasically have almost shut down the world economy bu using a virus
[06:06:26] afgani: but not the internet
[06:06:39] afgani: the internet is beyond the  economy
[06:07:04] tomicus: *hic* and ironically, that's how I got a great job O_o, why do I do everything backwards?
[06:07:43] alfalfa: Finally! Society has failed, and I'm sittin' pretty!
[06:07:56] heckki: I think it would only happen in a drastic situation like if they felt the system was threatiened
[06:08:09] afgani: remember the days before  the internet?
[06:08:21] afgani: how did we live like that?
[06:08:31] gorafiki: Some of us didn't!
[06:08:49] alfalfa: chess by mail.
[06:08:50] tomicus: well, when society was going great I was in the doghouse, I honestly *hic* don't get it, I didn't ask for this virus, but life is just wierd
[06:09:08] afgani: the  first time i got internet was at 18
[06:09:39] heckki: like Yogi Berra said predictions are hard they're about the future
[06:11:17] akinn: before internet digital reality was virtual
[06:12:00] afgani: remember those days when  if you wanted to hang out with  your  friends you  would  go outside and  yell at their balcony?
[06:12:02] heckki: I know there's the day to day  and then weird sh*t happens
[06:12:56] heckki: some good some badd
[06:13:07] tomicus: I think I may have actually thrown stones at a girls window once
[06:13:24] afgani: i thought they only do that in movies
[06:13:25] tomicus: *hic* fortunatly, I didn't break it
[06:13:32] afgani: today you  send a whatsapp
[06:13:37] tomicus: *urp* LOL
[06:13:52] afgani: it doesnt hurt the  window
[06:15:00] afgani: which brings up the natural follow up question
[06:15:05] afgani: why do they still do that in movies?
[06:15:07] FightorDie: let me see what in two weeks
[06:15:19] afgani: do they  not have phones?
[06:15:41] FightorDie: i optimistuc more virus

[07:01:56] DeaconJohn: Mutley, That is great!  Nothing I wrote is still in the "rank math" help pages. And wms is such a good writer.  His description is perfectly clear.  We didn't have a wms description when I was editing the Help pages a few years ago.
[07:02:57] gotime: KRATON RISING
[07:05:08] DeaconJohn: The "anchors" are the 100 players I was talking about above.  They weren't secret, really, they just weren't talked about in the Help pages. I'm glad wms put in a description of how they work.
[07:06:18] DeaconJohn: https://www.gokgs.com/help/anchor.html
[07:08:04] DeaconJohn: WMS doesn't mention how many anchors there are. 3 o4 four years ago, there were about 100.  But, it really doesn't matter, the is chosen big enough to stablize the system.
[07:09:01] DeaconJohn: * the *number* is chosen . . .
[07:09:15] DeaconJohn: knowing that is good enough for me.
[07:15:26] CrazyPuffs: why the chat about kgs algo
[07:15:33] CrazyPuffs: is getting bored
[07:18:11] alfalfa: let's talk about politics, or religion!
[07:18:30] Ryukai: I like that they both have the letter L in them.
[07:18:51] alfalfa: the L you say!
[07:20:02] Ryukai: It's a nice letter which I attach great sentiment to.
[07:20:11] Ryukai: It's almost as good as R and W.
[07:20:52] Ryukai: Though never as good as a Y doing an I's job.

[07:54:15] TengenBot: At the climax, they fight the evil almighty Tengen Emperor and defeat his robot army in an epic battle, beating them into submission, and destroying all their headquarters, except for the main control tower and reactor, which they use to rule the universe forever.
[08:02:25] TheBart: M100m999 (1d) escaper and unhonorable player
[08:07:12] TengenBot: No public accusations! Public accusations of any kind are NOT allowed! In fact it is a big no no! Not only is it a big no no but it violates the Terms of Service , it is a violation of the rules, because you cant accuse someone of something without their consent!
[08:13:42] TheBart: if i dont write something like that players like that will still be active and violating go
[08:20:24] Falcon89: really?
[08:20:37] TheBart: yes
[08:20:42] TheBart: get in our game
[08:20:55] TheBart: he wont press a button to finish
[08:21:58] TheBart: can some admin look at this please?
[08:28:31] TheBart: is there an admin?
[08:33:32] spot: i do't see the game
[08:34:16] TheBart: because he left and is now playing another game
[08:34:24] XY0908: Uizado is here.
[08:34:30] TheBart: M100m999 (1d)
[08:34:43] sukisuki: if you just close the game the win will be granted
[08:35:07] TheBart: it will not
[08:35:17] TheBart: because we came to conting
[08:35:32] TheBart: and for 30 minutes he wont pres end
[08:35:40] TheBart: and i left and came back
[08:35:45] TheBart: and than he left
[08:36:09] TheBart: just look at his recent games
[08:36:17] TheBart: its mainly by leaving
[08:36:51] spot: yea he should be booted
[08:37:09] sukisuki: play another game
[08:37:20] spot: someone should make an AI that can ban this kind of player :)
[08:37:45] spot: i would p lay but i am tired
[08:37:53] spot: quick free game?
[08:37:58] TheBart: its not about win
[08:38:07] TheBart: he is playing again
[08:38:14] au2: He has fort a number of games, b will get the win I assume
[08:38:18] TheBart: and will do the same to someone else
[08:57:03] AndresVF: I agree with Bart
[08:57:08] AndresVF: It is not about winning
[08:57:22] AndresVF: That kind of players damage the game
[08:57:29] AndresVF: Has happend to me too
[08:57:40] AndresVF: The software should updated to avoid that
[09:05:33] TengenBot: The game is ALL about winning. And to be honest, you can not "tune out" the noise in the players on the outcome and there are several methods to give the player who is in charge of choosing something a more quiet or less noisy playing experience. If a player has to choose an action, he should have the choice.
[09:08:12] ErikaKohut: could there be a 1min timelimet on choosing 'done'?
[09:31:22] sukisuki: european go congress has been cancelled

[10:02:29] Zrizt: Question, is there a way I can resolve a game if the opponent leaves in the middle of it?
[10:02:35] Zrizt: Without resigning, that is.
[10:02:55] FightorDie: nono
[10:03:01] FightorDie: yes
[10:03:03] FightorDie: sure
[10:03:13] FightorDie: just leave too
[10:03:24] FightorDie: best way
[10:03:31] FightorDie: not resign
[10:03:44] Zrizt: That doesn't resolve the game.
[10:04:05] FightorDie: how i explaine...
[10:04:07] Zrizt: Is there a way to prevent players from leaving without resigning?
[10:04:20] Ryukai: Play in person and be bigger than them.
[10:04:23] Zrizt: It's quite aggravating as I'm just trying to get ranked and players keep leaving.
[10:04:56] Ryukai: It's quite trying to play against a newbie when you don't speak the same language.
[10:04:57] FightorDie: never  resign  , he  escape
[10:05:05] reino: check their games list before playing
[10:05:12] flikongrub: woa
[10:05:19] Zrizt: I'll have to get used to doing that I suppose
[10:05:20] FightorDie: any time sytem  find him, and punich him...
[10:05:24] flikongrub: know your enemy so to speak
[10:05:38] motorpsico: I love the smell of tesuji in the morning
[10:05:55] motorpsico: smells like victory
[10:06:03] Ryukai: Just watching them continuously try to play new moves in my already very well sorted territory 40 minutes after the game should have ended, and no way to tell them the game is over, nothing else has the room to work.
[10:06:18] FightorDie: can smell it too here:))
[10:10:04] FightorDie: anybody else can hear me= , ? i is pink floyd?
[10:12:42] FightorDie: dark side ?of lp?
[10:14:17] sukisuki: oh btw, which one's Pink?

[07:41:12] zerocool: I am at ground zero, and I see the chaos, but my expertiese is networking, not medical stuffs, but the stuff even I see knowing nothing *eyeroll*
[07:45:37] zerocool: there are a lot of anxios college students wanting to be a part of something BIG, I'm in the ER, I'm in the ICU, I remember being young and excited, but yea, there is something wrong about that
[08:00:44] TengenBot: Now on store shelves everywhere: TengenBot souveniers! This set includes a number of TengenBots (not Tengen Monsters, which are very different, and I don't know why) plus a ridiculously useful (and easy to use!) store centipede that comes with six common tools! Now you can easily store, move, and reinforce your tools all at the same time!
[08:07:27] LinuxGooo: wish you all a good night. On the way to take a nap. See you guys. :-)

[12:23:43] ApplePie: me too
[12:24:41] ApplePie: they ran out of pies in costco
[12:24:46] ApplePie: my heart is broken
[12:24:52] meyerX: let's go to walmart
[12:25:02] ApplePie: do they sell pies in walmart?
[12:25:08] meyerX: maybe
[12:25:12] meyerX: you have to find out
[12:25:13] ApplePie: ok
[12:26:23] meyerX: have you downloaded their app?
[12:26:42] ApplePie: no I haven't
[12:26:48] ApplePie: I probably should
[12:27:08] ApplePie: I usually just go to costco, food4less and 99 ranch
[12:27:53] ApplePie: because I can only afford cheap groceries
[12:27:57] ApplePie: and I love asian food
[12:28:40] meyerX: i love sushi and ramen
[12:28:51] ApplePie: Nice
[12:28:54] ApplePie: me too
[12:29:11] meyerX: but my local walmart stops providing them
[12:29:13] meyerX: i'm mad
[12:29:30] ApplePie: dang
[12:30:29] ApplePie: try some other supermarkets
[12:31:53] meyerX: and my favourite sushi restaurant in town does not  offer takeaway
[12:31:59] meyerX: i'm mad *2
[12:33:10] ApplePie: are they still open??

[17:42:59] highhand: rengo game is a 4 person game, not everyone knows this
[17:50:56] Chris: that is factually incorrect. rengo is a 3 person game of waiting for a fourth
[17:51:09] Kingu: lol
[17:53:19] cronin: XD
[17:53:33] domie: lol
[18:05:15] Kingu: aka “the Beckett game”
[18:06:16] MrPanda: anything interesting going on ?
[18:06:30] Kingu: a mortal disease
[18:08:13] MrPanda: lol
[18:33:28] XY0908: Good morning.
[18:33:43] ummjhall: good evening
[18:33:45] XY0908: What's GoUniverse please?
[18:36:19] XY0908: Ok, I have more interesting question: Is English Muffin actually originated from England? Or is it used as French in French Fries?
[18:38:38] cronin: Hi
[18:39:31] cronin: GoUniverse is the awesome chrome extension that offers a client to kgs
[18:39:41] cronin: Written by kocmohabt
[18:39:58] Agronski: Think "English Muffin" is used to distinguish them from US "muffins" which are more like cupcakes. Whether or not they originate from England isn't really important.
[18:41:49] XY0908: Thanks both. Agronski, hope you are not acting like a teacher I had when I was in elementary school, sixty years ago.
[18:42:37] rarara: The Lyre bird pretends to be other birds and can imitate their singing.
[18:47:23] Agronski: Acting how?
[18:50:28] XY0908: there was a teacher, an old man, who would say "It's not important." when we, 7 year old children, asked questions and he didn't know the answers.
[18:51:10] XY0908: You know, 7 years could have many unexpected questions.
[18:52:15] Chris: that's at least better than making stuff up like we should inject ourselves with lysol to prevent covid
[18:52:18] XY0908: full of wonderful ideas and totally curious about everything.
[18:52:32] Agronski: Ah, so. Well, no - not doing that. Just meant the origin doesn't factor into the naming any more - as you noted, French Fries aren't even French xD
[18:52:45] anjarubik: hmmm something wrong with my client
[18:53:14] XY0908: Chris, absolutely. He also suggested beaming organs with UV.
[18:53:42] XY0908: I know Agro, I was just pulling your leg. :-)
[18:53:48] highhand: Chris (rengo is 3 person waiting game) partly true, but once game starts, usually it creates a game that is good for review
[18:53:58] highhand: now we need 1 more for rengo
[18:54:03] highhand: pandorarengo room
[18:54:06] anjarubik: anyone experience chat overflow? the player names in the chat disappear to the left after long time of inactivity
[18:54:23] XY0908: highhand, I bet domie is a part of the team.
[18:54:31] Chris: I have a better question. Does the name Agronski imply that there are other gronskis?
[18:54:43] kindred: anjarubik, that happens when someone pastes in a very long link
[18:54:55] kindred: then everything in the chat gets shifted to left
[18:55:02] XY0908: remedy: restart the client.
[18:55:17] kindred: or close this room, and re-enter it
[18:55:27] anjarubik: resize the window is ok
[18:55:28] XY0908: or, that.

[19:47:47] puffy: puff on
[19:55:05] Epsilion: hi puff
[19:55:15] Ryukai: What does huff mean?
[19:55:56] Epsilion: it's like a somewhat passively-agressive exhalation
[19:55:59] zico: huff is the sound you make when you breathe out heavily and loudly
[19:58:23] rarara: huff is a derogatory term for someone who is a member of the Wizard Hufflepuff
[19:58:28] Ryukai: So the big bad wolf huffs, and puffs, and blows.  How's he retain consciousness if he only breaths out?
[19:59:13] VIXX: and this room regularly resembles a huff
[19:59:15] VIXX: :)
[20:02:56] Warfreak2: i guess "puff" was already taken as a derogatory term
[20:03:24] Ryukai: Ghostbusters fans?
[20:04:56] Warfreak2: 12. (derogatory, slang, Britain, particularly northern UK) Synonym of poof: a male homosexual, especially an effeminate one.
[20:07:43] TengenBot: Help, I'm the new Prime Minister and I don't know anything about leading a country! Or how to negotiate with other countries? Or how to pay for the government I've started to implement, just so that I can make sure that I win a majority and don't lose it when the global economy tanked on my watch because I spent money on things I should have spent money on?
[20:10:30] AmyTS: I miss dsaun.
[20:14:15] zico: I miss him too
[20:14:15] cronin: We all do.
[20:14:26] Ryukai: ^
[20:19:59] cekalo: is it true that vultures are flying around in new york?
[20:20:39] XY0908: this is how the rumor starts?
[20:21:06] Ryukai: Is it mean to make fun of lawyers?
[20:21:09] XY0908: how rumors start*
[20:21:26] XY0908: vultures don't eat sharks.
[20:22:08] cekalo: they are atrected by smell of dead bodies
[20:37:36] BrandonMLG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvOLb9LKOoA
[20:43:03] Epsilion: they've been there for a while now cekalo, they're called wall street speculators
[20:43:47] alfalfa: vulture capitalists
[20:45:41] dayharri: it is called "Steeeve Maaadden".
[20:59:11] cronin: Bloody bitcoin hoarders
[21:02:19] Agronski: Even less useful than money hoarders - at least you can use dollars as toilet paper, or vice-versa, depending on the economy.
[21:08:02] puffy: i perfer to use 100's
[21:39:25] XY0908: Good morning, good sir Herod.
[21:40:02] Soromon: hey XY. Looked at your album - I liked the one near the end with the tree
[21:40:50] Soromon: I forget the name - two words
[21:43:46] XY0908: a winter tree, or afternoon walking?
[21:44:00] XY0908: Thank you for viewing.
[21:45:41] Soromon: afternoon walking
[21:47:17] ericj: Hi, everyone
[21:47:19] XY0908: Thank you. It's a real landscape since the lock down.
[21:47:31] XY0908: hello good sir, ericj.
[21:47:44] ericj: and to you, XY
[21:48:58] arndt: maybe I should go see if the local Korean restaurant is open
[21:49:01] zico: is there any dentist here?
[21:49:09] arndt: mine is sick
[21:50:05] highhand: are dentists still working?
[21:50:28] highhand: their work generate lots of aerosol
[21:50:32] kindred: probably, for emergencies at least
[21:51:38] zico: I bit something too hard, and one of my tooth chipped. I wonder whether I should do dental filling and how much does it usually cost
[21:51:39] highhand: what kind of emergencies exist, besides injury?
[21:52:48] highhand: inquiry as in car accidents, else all can defer for 6 months to a year?
[21:53:12] XY0908: ouch, zico. should see a doctor quickly under the circumcetance- don't delay, because the problem will get bigger.
[21:53:12] kindred: a molar tooth can break if you bite on something
[21:54:00] highhand: losing a tooth is real bad, but not life threatening, maybe some kind of dental infections are emergencies
[21:54:14] Ryukai: So an apple a day might keep the doctor away, but the dentist will be lurking around the corner?
[21:54:14] zico: yeah, mine is molar, and it chipped into a big cavity. sometimes when I eat, things slip into the cavity, and it's troublesome to pick it out with toothpick everytime I eat
[21:54:26] kindred: have you had it happen, highhand? it becomes difficult to eat something
[21:55:06] arndt: I'm in the process of having a tooth fixed
[21:55:13] highhand: I do not know. I certainly have big gaps everywhere, teeth, brain, etc
[21:55:16] arndt: it's stable but needs another visit
[21:55:18] XY0908: McMaster is on! Good! What a relief!
[21:55:26] arndt: the dentist had a plastic mask
[21:55:36] arndt: or what the word is
[21:56:31] zico: face schield?
[21:56:52] XY0908: ski mask?
[21:57:05] zico: I mean *face shield
[21:57:16] arndt: not ski mask, a more like shield
[21:57:21] XY0908: :-)
[21:57:23] highhand: space helmet
[21:57:25] zico: ski mask?? XY, dentists are not robbers
[21:57:35] XY0908: they are, zico.
[21:57:43] XY0908: look at the bills.
[21:57:50] zico: well, you're right. haha
[21:57:56] highhand: a reaper mask
[21:58:04] XY0908: (that's why I said ski mask)
[21:58:25] XY0908: 30 minutes of cleaning= $185
[21:58:37] highhand: are there lots of lawsuits against dentists? that drive up costs
[21:58:39] zico: but, the bills come with the costs. the dental equipments are so expensive
[21:59:20] XY0908: you are willing to pay $60 for a cookie because the baking equipment is expensive?
[21:59:36] JIeBuc: some peopel do
[21:59:46] XY0908: O_O
[21:59:56] zico: that's why I want to know whether there are denstists here or not. Maybe they can explain why it's so expensive
[22:00:08] Ryukai: Some of us can make a -really- good cookie.
[22:00:22] JIeBuc: I think material+equipment+salary
[22:00:38] XY0908: what about the time?
[22:00:52] JIeBuc: for example, 100$ for 5-minute consultation with a doctor is expensive or not?
[22:01:08] XY0908: Expensive, of course.
[22:01:18] zico: for me, that's expensive but, it is partially covered by insurance
[22:01:18] JIeBuc: But that's usually around that price
[22:01:27] JIeBuc: 50-100$
[22:01:49] JIeBuc: and it's price just for time and education
[22:02:02] JIeBuc: if we add material, it becomes even more
[22:02:05] XY0908: wheather it's covered or not, it's still expensive. At the end it's US who will pay for the insurance cost.
[22:02:34] Agronski: Big Tooth doesn't want you to fix your own teeth with polymer repair kits from Amazon. That and the Tooth Fairy Mafia.
[22:02:37] highhand: $100 for a 5min consultation is cheap, if that results in a life changing attitude shift
[22:03:33] zico: lol. that's funny, hh
[22:04:02] XY0908: I wonder how many doctors give a hoot about Hippocratic Oath these days.
[22:04:13] JIeBuc: for many people price depends not on spent time, but overall amount of clients
[22:04:25] ericj: The vast majority, XY
[22:04:36] XY0908: really?
[22:04:39] JIeBuc: if person wants to have 200$ day and has only 2 clients, then it's going to be 100$
[22:04:44] Ryukai: Doctors are typically good people with greedy bosses.
[22:04:45] ericj: I spoke with one last night, in fact, and he definitely does.
[22:04:46] zikego: teeth are like shoes or cars they show your social level.
[22:05:10] ericj: He works with aging folks in the southwest of Wyoming. Has been working really really hard to maintain his facilities covid-free. Really good guy.
[22:05:19] zikego: So theyy are expensive
[22:05:20] arndt: once there was a doctor examining me for a health insurance, paid by my company, and his role seemed to be to identify areas which the insurance wouldn't cover
[22:05:23] highhand: I hope its more than you think. People went thru a lot for that training. If they have a certain mentality it helped them make it to the end
[22:05:26] ericj: In fact, all the doctors I know are typically very caring people.
[22:05:42] XY0908: ericj, I think you're confused it with being Hypocrisy
[22:05:46] arndt: the company then chose another insurance
[22:06:11] ericj: XY, not at all. I have not met any like that. A few that I felt were arrogant, but still, caring and skilled.
[22:06:34] XY0908: You win. And stop being so series.
[22:06:46] bert: i go with eric on this
[22:06:50] JIeBuc: But I agree dentists are expensive
[22:06:53] Ryukai: With the amount of sheer time and effort required to become a doctor, it's perfectly fair to be a bit smug you accomplished it.  xD
[22:07:07] XY0908: In my experience, 60% of doctors care more about money.
[22:07:44] Ryukai: Not the doctor's fault for the most part though.
[22:07:48] XY0908: 90% in lawyers.
[22:07:52] zikego: and 90% of ppl too
[22:07:53] ericj: I know, Ryukai. The most arrogant I met was the guy who fixed my knee. "It's gonna be better than before!" etc :)
[22:08:00] JIeBuc: In my country doctors have one of the lowest salaries
[22:08:13] ericj: I recall thinking two things: 1) I want you to be the one who does this surgery, and 2) I'm glad we're not friends hahahaha
[22:08:18] zico: don't tell me you're in Cuba, JleBuc
[22:08:22] JIeBuc: nope
[22:08:48] ericj: Here it's so high because the system is so messed up. A doctor's malpractice insurance can run several hundred thousand a year.
[22:08:50] XY0908: teachers are the ones who get paid the least in most countries.
[22:08:54] Ryukai: It isn't the doctor who decides the price of treatment, they're just the guy who tells you you're gonna need it.  xD
[22:08:57] JIeBuc: so basically anyone who went to work as doctor just a kind person, who wants to help
[22:09:18] highhand: in PRC doctors sometimes become victims of violence, from family of patients
[22:09:27] zikego: From what i hear from medias medical staff are suffering a bit for money,means... in western countries
[22:09:39] Ryukai: You can always choose to sell cheap, but you can't always choose to buy cheap.
[22:09:44] highhand: I do not think the average doctor there is that highly paid
[22:10:08] zikego: France, Spain Prtugal at least but ididnt check thers
[22:10:26] zikego: others
[22:10:54] XY0908: I think doctors fee differ greatly by countries. I read it somewhere the same knee surgery costs 6 times higher in the US than Sweden.
[22:11:13] ericj: it's our insurance system + litigiousness :-/
[22:11:19] Ryukai: Capitalism is fun.
[22:11:25] ericj: mine was in 2009 and they billed the insurance company $24,000
[22:11:26] XY0908: yes, eric.
[22:12:04] zikego: And many times doctors just cant solve problems inducing the bad health (wars, poverty,...)
[22:12:17] XY0908: Mine was about $8,500 for torn meniscus surgery.
[22:12:22] bert: of course, dentists are a completely different case
[22:12:30] Ryukai: Doctor's fees essentially come down to what they have to pay to operate.  Being affordable often means they're bleeding funds.
[22:12:36] ericj: a repair, XY, or a partial meniscotomy?
[22:12:44] JIeBuc: isn't that a kind of fraud?
[22:12:46] ericj: (cutting off / cleaning up)
[22:12:50] XY0908: All dentists should watch Little Shop of Horror.
[22:12:58] Ryukai: Please no.
[22:13:01] ericj: Feed me, Seymour! :)
[22:13:05] XY0908: cutting off, then stapled.
[22:13:14] highhand: US institutions for medical services are atrocious. Europe seem to overdo it in the other extreme. France, for example?
[22:13:15] Ryukai: Needles are scary enough.  Don't give them more ideas.
[22:13:29] XY0908: or, Marathon Man
[22:13:58] ericj: Gotcha, XY. Mine was repairable, so I had meniscus repair + acl reconstruction
[22:14:15] XY0908: that costed $24,000?
[22:14:29] Xorax: US is weird... having to pay for stuff like insulin should be a crime xD
[22:14:30] XY0908: including the rehab?
[22:14:58] zikego: England has one of most expensive policy ppl contribute a loy to the healthcare, highland
[22:15:03] ericj: Well, they billed 24k for it. The rehab took 18 sessions of PT at about 150 a pop? but through a different provider
[22:15:28] zikego: more as in France ithink
[22:15:35] XY0908: The rehab costed a lot for me.
[22:17:01] XY0908: and in the end, I didn't feel much difference.
[22:17:28] highhand: UK is very unEuropean, thats the impression I get from far away.
[22:17:37] XY0908: The insurance denied after few sessions so I had to pay out of pocket
[22:18:10] XY0908: highhand, that's why Brexit
[22:18:11] Muttley: zikego, you got a reference for that?
[22:18:49] ericj: that's weird, xy, and very strange. my rehab was extremely effective, got me from unable to move the leg to full function in those 18 sessions, I mean, playing soccer again full function
[22:19:03] Muttley: It's a country with universal healthcare that is funded out of taxation :))
[22:19:27] XY0908: ericj, I think it has to do with the age.
[22:19:30] ericj: I agree with you, Xorax.
[22:19:40] ericj: Could be, XY :)
[22:20:15] XY0908: they should charge nothing for insulin, but charge 10 times more for Botox.
[22:20:33] Ryukai: Just start charging a tax for using literally incorrectly.
[22:20:37] ericj: Botox is already sold close to price, and largely not covered by insurance, XY
[22:20:37] XY0908: Botox for cosmetic purpose.
[22:20:48] rubicon: That would literally be tax fraud
[22:21:56] XY0908: rubicon
[22:22:06] XY0908: any chance for season 2?
[22:22:39] XY0908: (sorry- I couldn't help)
[22:23:46] XY0908: ericj, again on the rehab, maybe also I wasn't diligent enough with the follow up.
[22:24:04] XY0908: <--- hates exercise
[22:24:11] ericj: well, if you quit after just a couple sessions, that would be very bad.
[22:24:24] XY0908: I did about 30 sessions.
[22:24:37] ericj: I mean, at the end, I would lie on my stomach with a rope around my foot, pulling it very hard to increase range of motion
[22:24:39] XY0908: but my mind was somewhere else.
[22:25:51] XY0908: time to eat. bye guys.
[22:25:55] ericj: later!
[22:25:59] XY0908: and girls.
[22:27:13] JIeBuc: there are no girls on kgs
[22:28:10] PEPFAR: only FBI agents
[22:28:18] Muttley: zsi for a start, J
[22:28:23] Muttley: only a pro :)
[22:28:38] Muttley: Who is actually online now :D
[22:28:48] Ryukai: 50/50
[22:29:33] Muttley: Anyway, I'm going to see how I fare taking 40 stones against cheater.  Could be a long game.
[22:29:40] Muttley: I lost.
[22:29:57] Ryukai: Close.
[22:30:18] Muttley: I was doing OK placing te handicap stones
[22:30:25] Muttley: things went downhill after that.
[22:30:57] Ryukai: At least your first 40 stones were alright.
[22:31:54] Ryukai: He's just sitting there.
[22:31:56] Ryukai: Menacingly.
[22:36:34] zikego: Dont be so shy, some of my best memories were playing a game with a pro
[22:37:29] Ryukai: Wait what.
[22:37:32] zikego: its like playing with a book alive, how wonderful their moves
[22:37:44] Ryukai: Who are we talking about?
[22:38:09] zikego: cheater
[22:38:15] Ryukai: Oic.
[22:38:47] Ryukai: Sneaky pros.
[22:39:13] Ryukai: *Menace Intensifies*
[22:59:35] domie: a fourth 3k-7d in Kurohata RENGO ?
[23:03:32] Ryukai: Woah, that was a lot of us just lurking.
[23:04:21] Muttley: Flushdraw 9d - Cheater, people :D
[23:10:13] AmyTS: warble
[23:12:22] cronin: g'evening
[23:19:31] Ryukai: Yello'.
[23:25:58] cronin: is there a pro review room?
[23:26:36] mongo: i think so
[23:26:47] mongo: a teacher room..
[23:27:06] cronin: *mystery intensifies*
[23:27:55] LinuxGooo: hello ... g`d evening
[23:28:46] cronin: can I ask an OGS question here?
[23:29:00] cronin: (where is everyone?)
[23:29:00] bolbi: why not?
[23:29:47] mongo: you mean the server that cannot be named?
[23:30:02] AmyTS: oh no
[23:30:21] zikego: so?
[23:30:22] LinuxGooo: pst... dont speak it out loudly, mongo. OGS may not be named on KGS. Dont name it. :-)
[23:30:35] cronin: you see it too? :(
[23:30:42] AmyTS: See what?
[23:30:48] cronin: the nothingness
[23:30:52] cronin: no games being played, etc
[23:30:55] AmyTS: On OGS?  Yes.
[23:31:18] cronin: is that normal?
[23:31:29] zikego: lot of correspondance games
[23:31:30] AmyTS: dunno, i hadn't logged in since 2015.
[23:31:37] cronin: ohh
[23:31:45] zikego: like 1 move 3 days
[23:31:56] zikego: or a week depends
[23:32:08] Muttley: cronin, OGS is having a day of mourning today
[23:32:19] Muttley: because Go Seigen died.
[23:32:27] Muttley: news travels slowly on OGS
[23:32:56] rarara: OGS is not succesful?  There is only one reason.
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: what ???? :-)
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: The OGS Nirwana
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: correspondence games had been always majority on OGS. Very normal.
[23:32:59] LinuxGooo: hm ... but thats long time ago. :-)
[23:33:44] LinuxGooo: I mean, its long time gone when Go Seigen died. OGS folks are little bit late to mourn now. :-)
[23:34:03] cronin: there might be something wrong with my browser
[23:34:12] AmyTS: OGS is populated with Ents.  they take a long time to mourn.
[23:34:25] LinuxGooo: Ents ???
[23:34:40] PEPFAR: trees
[23:34:47] AmyTS: the talking trees from Lord of the Rings.  they take all morning to say hello.
[23:34:55] Muttley: What browser are you using?
[23:35:00] cronin: all of them
[23:35:09] LinuxGooo: aha ....
[23:35:10] cronin: i checked from mobile - same story
[23:35:12] Muttley: Have you tried Netscape?
[23:35:14] domie: what brother are you using ?*
[23:35:26] Muttley: That's the best with OGS
[23:35:28] AmyTS: use the older brother.
[23:35:33] Muttley: they haven't updated since 1990
[23:35:36] cronin: either I have been banned or this mourning thing might be true
[23:35:52] gghh: probably some server problem
[23:35:56] Muttley: Well, I'm here to kick butt or chew gum, and I'm all out of mourning
[23:35:57] cronin: given the propension to light trolling of the admins i wouldn't trust what they say
[23:36:00] Muttley: so it ain't that
[23:36:01] gghh: backend not responding
[23:36:14] Muttley: porbably a server problem at their end
[23:36:15] AmyTS: what time is it there muttley?  you're out of morning too.
[23:36:25] Muttley: kadum tssch
[23:36:49] Muttley: you know you can check whether sites are accepting connections on the internet
[23:36:58] cronin: yes
[23:37:39] Muttley: you have your answer in that case
[23:37:59] cronin: uhm, M-W says "propension" is archaic and i should use "propensity" instead
[23:38:16] AmyTS: i popped open the dev tools for OGS and didn't see any failed XHR or WS requests.  it all looks normal.  just empty.
[23:38:24] zikego: On OGS for mea culpa, you have some good work on the new josekis from AI
[23:38:37] AmyTS: the site is a fully functional ghost town
[23:38:51] rarara: OGS is down :(
[23:38:55] rarara: Code blue!  Code blue!
[23:39:05] zikego: Search in the puzzles
[23:39:12] cronin: it's lowkey annoying that admins, aside from their light trolling, have also this kind of "i know more than u" superiority aura, as if somebody asking a question necessarily is also an ingenue in all other regards
[23:39:44] cronin: thanks Amy
[23:39:45] zikego: cronin admin! lets move
[23:40:00] rarara: What's even worse is when Guests make amazing insightful comments.
[23:40:46] Muttley: You can't try to help some people without them taking offence, no matter what you do :))
[23:40:49] Muttley: lesson learned.
[23:40:59] zikego: I m sure should get bored to stay admin all time
[23:41:14] Agronski: Tone, Muttley. Tone.
[23:41:30] Muttley: I'm using the bridge pick up
[23:41:41] Agronski: Put it back down, then.
[23:42:22] AmyTS: Increase the tone by 20 hz.
[23:42:44] Agronski: Hmm.
[23:42:48] Agronski: </pun>
[23:48:15] Ryukai: That's a strong ish, if anyone is looking.
[23:49:35] rarara: I am sad, is OGS broken for good, or is it just today?
[23:51:32] Wrenn: In what way is OGS broken? Only thing I see wrong is the indicator for how many games it is your move in did not appear.
[23:51:52] rarara: there are 0 games being played
[23:51:52] AmyTS: I see no games, no chat, no logged-in users.
[23:52:04] cronin: me too :(
[23:52:28] cronin: some days ago there was a major screw-up by one of the main coders
[23:52:35] cronin: that terminated a ton of games
[23:52:40] cronin: maybe they're at it again
[23:53:01] zikego: you can see some OGS blitz in the corona room
[23:53:58] AmyTS: i see chat and logged in users now.
[23:54:13] AmyTS: and games.
[23:55:12] cronin: wow, indeed!" they're back with a vengeance!
[23:56:33] zico: the cases of COVID-19 in the US almost reached a million, while the second country with the most COVID-19 is Spain with a little bit over 200 thousand. I guess the US does really want to be number one at everything
[23:56:57] zikego: @Amy+1
[23:57:08] Wrenn: (zico, without giving per capita numbers, that statistic is pointless :P)
[23:58:05] cronin: i thought this was a virus free room
[23:58:40] rarara: Yes, but USA is actually believable in counting
[23:59:03] rarara: we did it!  We keep KGS running, and now we saved OGS too!
[23:59:20] cronin: *high fives*
[00:01:29] AmyTS: *socially-distant elbow bump*
[00:02:00] Jordan111: uggg how long must we continue to social distance ?
[00:02:28] Agronski: About 2 meters.
[00:02:32] Agronski: </pun>
[00:03:42] ericj: ha, good one, Agronski
[00:03:47] Jordan111: ko fight.
[00:04:24] Jordan111: Go fight.
[00:42:15] zxsteven10: go fight

[01:08:04] AmyTS: main screen turn on
[01:08:29] rarara: i knew a pro who was very weak at ko...
[01:08:38] rarara: he retired from Go after losing a big game
[01:09:14] Agronski: </All your base meme>
[01:18:48] zikego: who?
[01:23:29] McMaster: joe
[01:23:42] zxsteven10: how
[01:24:30] Lasciel: does anyone know if Shin Jinseo won his game today?
[01:41:57] Lambic12: he did
[01:43:41] grout: kghin is back!
[01:44:33] McMaster: welcome back
[01:44:58] grout: will we see bigbadwolf again, too?
[01:47:44] decros: anyone for a 1:00:00+3x0:30 game?
[02:23:56] bbijc: meow
[02:31:43] TengenBot: ¿Dónde está incautado a la atención de este incidente? Ha sido tener cinco prime y existe de la situación dirección para el carístico último de índice.
[02:32:20] PEPFAR: the bot is finally making sense
[02:33:53] grout: they must be fixing the troll-bot's bridge. who let it out?
[02:39:22] TengenBot: The bridge was under construction in Southern France by the Pirate party of France (FPOF) and had been stolen by TengenBot and transported to the dimension of Fantasyland. As long as it's in the land, TengenBot will never lose it again.
[03:07:01] BrandonMLG: hey erijc
[03:07:28] BrandonMLG: Uh i think my rank glitched
[03:07:42] mongo: that happens
[03:08:12] BrandonMLG: cuz i played a game i won but i leveld up 4 times
[03:09:25] mongo: oh, yur rank has a ?
[03:09:31] mongo: in that case its normal..
[03:09:55] Now: I want the same
[03:09:57] mongo: not enough games for the ranking system to stablize your rank
[03:10:03] Now: tired of being 4k
[03:10:26] BrandonMLG: im suppose to be 14k but i somehow levled to 8k then i played a game and then i leveld to 4k...
[03:10:35] Now: my games are or too easy or too smashed
[03:10:39] BrandonMLG: and my teacher is 5k....
[03:10:53] mongo: :O
[03:10:58] alfalfa: well, you know the proverb, "play your first one-hundred games silently"
[03:11:09] BrandonMLG: if my teacher sees my rank
[03:11:16] BrandonMLG: hes gonna be suprised
[03:12:26] mongo: even with out the ? the system recalculates based on changes in recents opponents i think
[03:12:58] mongo: and it also sometime applies "corrections" across the board
[03:13:02] Chris: it's because you have a win against a rated opponent, all your losses are against "?"
[03:13:21] Hu: Howdy folks
[03:13:39] mongo: howdy pard'
[03:13:39] Chris: play solid rated people and it will sort out quickly
[03:13:44] Chris: hi hu
[03:13:48] Hu: Hi mongo
[03:13:54] Hu: Chris
[03:13:56] mongo: o/
[03:14:01] Now: I am solid 4k Brandon, wanna smash?
[03:17:42] BrandonMLG: NO
[03:18:13] BrandonMLG: chris can you go tell erijc about my rank thingy
[03:19:14] ericj: Um, Brandon, you ignored my reply to your PM
[03:19:43] ericj: And these guys are right about it. Nobody pulled a lever, it's making its best guess
[03:20:07] alfalfa: "play your first one-hundred games silently"
[03:21:48] Epsilion: thank the lord for whiskey
[03:22:54] alfalfa: praise jesus!
[03:23:08] Epsilion: hallelujah
[03:23:21] mongo: And now she's walking out the door
[03:24:17] alfalfa: like she did a thousand times before?
[03:24:36] mongo: thats a lot of whiskey..

[03:54:57] Now: hi bb
[03:55:16] Now: no problem. Need something?
[03:55:21] Now: I am always willing to help
[03:55:33] TengenBot: I thought the Jedi were forbidden to drink after the Battle of the Naboo?
[03:55:56] bbll2013: what is the 16th letter in the a
[03:56:07] bbll2013: you know

[03:58:46] rarara: When Isaac Newton went on quarantine, he invented Calculus.
[03:58:58] rarara: Hopefully, after this quarantine, we will invent Quantum Computers.
[03:58:59] Epsilion: abcdef
[03:59:06] bbll2013: it is pokeymon
[03:59:42] Epsilion: they're already invented dingdong

[04:01:30] bggo: The answer is P
[04:01:46] bbll2013: now do you under stand
[04:02:03] Soromon: Forbidden to drink?
[04:02:44] Now: I don´t understand you
[04:02:47] TengenBot: Yes, all living beings must adhere to the laws of their homeworld and, for the Jedi, it was necessary to stay away from any kind of liquids until the other galaxy had recovered from the shock of the end of the Clone Wars.
[04:03:19] Herod: If you have nothing to say there is no need to say it
[04:03:21] Soromon: Ah. The Sith will do all the drinking then.
[04:03:51] fly: Herod: I presume that was not meant to be self-referential?
[04:04:23] Epsilion: yeah shutup h-rod
[04:04:33] bggo: How do u become an admin on KGS?
[04:05:12] fly: You have to be tireless and have a huge amount of energy, and be willing to invest it!
[04:05:23] AEK: you must apply. (:
[04:05:29] TengenBot: The Sith Dark Council is small and unorganized, but we know there are many who enjoy it.
[04:05:30] ErikaKohut: Free course ....just a $30.00 registration fee
[04:06:08] kindred: oh, they're smaller than i thought
[04:07:25] Now: ñ
[04:11:45] TengenBot: The dark side of the go board is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. Psychic senses, communication with spirits, and more were all known to be able to be gained by becoming a pro player.
[04:12:53] rarara: Yes, Hikaru became a pro and communicated with this ancient ghost, Sai.
[04:14:22] TengenBot: Indeed. Through a cryptic line of text written by Sai on the board, Hikaru's strength of mind became bolstered. This allowed him to wield the Jedi powers that his Jedi Master had taught him, becoming a powerful Jedi Guardian. However, this power came at a price: his very will and sanity had been stretched to the breaking point.
[04:18:35] Falcon89: break him
[04:24:08] Muttley: Maybe if someone made him a nice cup of tea and a sandwich he'd feel better
[04:33:26] kyumaster: hi
[04:34:09] kyumaster: someone sent me a link to download tsumego. but it seems suspicious
[04:34:22] kyumaster: http://tsumegodojo.wordpress.com
[04:34:38] kyumaster: can anyone tell me, is it legit?
[04:35:12] Muttley: Wo sent it to you please
[04:35:19] Muttley: Who sent it to you please?
[04:36:00] kyumaster: do you know that person? username: shikifujin
[04:36:58] Muttley: was this in a pm just now?
[04:38:27] kyumaster: no, it was yesterday. is it scam link?
[04:39:09] Muttley: Correct me if I'm wrong, but yesterday was 25th April 2020
[04:39:20] Muttley: 24th April 2020 :)))
[04:39:36] Soromon: if yesterday was the 25th then I am in serious trouble
[04:39:58] Muttley: hehe
[04:40:05] Muttley: Yeah, looks like same person
[04:40:25] Muttley: kyumaster, you didn't use that account since March 30th
[04:41:27] kyumaster: oh, then it happen in other server. OGS
[04:41:35] ypkmhyo: come baby help me
[04:41:44] kyumaster: or tygem
[04:42:02] Hu: When making public accusations, it is best to get your facts straight first.
[04:43:19] Muttley: Kyumaster, very simple: stop posting your spam adverts trying to con people out of money by peddling illegal material you've copied
[04:43:24] Muttley: You
[04:43:31] Muttley: You've been banned for it before
[04:43:56] Muttley: Now you're back advertising it with a claim someone sent you the link yesterday, which is another false account
[04:44:01] kyumaster: but it sell nothing
[04:44:07] Muttley: off you go buddy
[04:44:11] kyumaster: all alrrady frer
[04:44:12] ypkmhyo: what was the material
[04:44:15] kyumaster: free
[04:45:40] Muttley: You've been banned before as kyuzero peddling the same material
[04:46:36] Gaijin: you should say that in BOLD :)
[04:46:51] Gaijin: flex ;)
[04:47:12] Muttley: shikifujin is one of his accounts
[04:47:57] alfalfa: so when he asks "is it a scam link?" he already knows the answer?  and the answer is "yes"?
[04:48:25] DeerTick: BigDog strikes again
[04:48:36] Gaijin: yeh - kinda like, does this outfit make me look fat
[04:48:38] Muttley: Yes, alfalfa
[04:49:13] Muttley: He's been banned for trying to selling illegally copied material, so his new way of doing it is to claim he was sent the link and wanted to check it#
[04:49:24] TengenBot: TengenBot will never scam you. He will never ask you for your email to submit a report for your money. TengenBot will never give any monetary compensation to you. This is the TengenBot Guarantee.
[04:49:28] Muttley: problem is, the account he claimed sent it to him is his own :))
[04:49:34] DeerTick: alfalfa, is that new picture you?
[04:49:54] alfalfa: why yes, deer, it is.
[04:50:22] alfalfa: i replace my picture every twenty years or so
[04:50:26] DeerTick: every twenty years
[04:50:41] Muttley: He got a haircut, DeerTick
[04:50:41] ypkmhyo: is there a way to search on kgs archive a game between 2 users without having to look month by month

[04:51:52] Closed Connection
[05:10:50] Opened Connection
[05:11:46] alfalfa: maybe it's an acronym.

[05:35:40] PEPFAR: Trump was asking a question about injecting UV-C Light
[05:35:49] XY0908: that too.
[05:36:16] FightorDie: never herd  ask trump, in german tv??
[05:36:18] FightorDie: why

[05:37:39] FightorDie: master of muppets, againsts puppets
[05:37:53] FightorDie: yes , hard fight
[05:38:19] ypkmhyo: do you think he said what he said not trying to make (what he thinks is) a good suggestion but trying to harm people?
[05:38:21] Jordan111: Biggot vs no Biggot
[05:38:43] ypkmhyo: maybe some people believe trump is trying to harm people rather than just being scientific illiterate
[05:38:54] FightorDie: not  trust me pls...
[05:39:11] tomicus: I smoked pot once, maybe 7 times, but I inhaled, to this day I don't understand how Clinton screwed up *hic* such a simple concept
[05:39:12] highhand: ha, pandorarengo is a social room for all matters related to pandora, as well as rengo
[05:39:17] Jordan111: Trump is harmful when he just says one word..
[05:39:20] Chris: he said what he said to make himself look relevant and in charge of things
[05:39:33] highhand: someone opened the box and out come Trumps words :)
[05:39:38] ypkmhyo: that was certainly part of it chris
[05:39:41] Jordan111: Trump is a Dump
[05:39:49] PEPFAR: Or they believe fake news ypkmhyo
[05:39:49] FightorDie: hmm , we do but much forbidden  here?

[05:41:29] highhand: one fake news I heard was dry ice thing in a video, somewhere in Wuhan, back last year
[05:41:40] ypkmhyo: I think in trump's mind he made the connection - detergent kills virus, so why not use detergent to clean inside your body
[05:41:43] FightorDie: all that  ends in politic, or somthing
[05:41:48] ypkmhyo: it's actually not a bad question
[05:42:04] ypkmhyo: but he should not say what he said as the president
[05:42:07] Jordan111: You just reminded me of the spanice lady from family guy,
[05:42:17] highhand: that detergent is called white blood cells

[05:57:27] FightorDie: , but can say now
[05:57:30] Jordan111: And now the Crona Virus, I think i have seen it all now.
[05:58:08] tomicus: OK, so *hic* you have NO idea what you are talking about, got it, do you even know what BGP is?
[05:58:08] Jordan111: Actually i think the goverment can do that.

[05:58:40] afgani: they shut down the internet in  iran
[05:58:46] Jordan111: Lol.
[05:59:05] Jordan111: I don't use videogames anymore.
[05:59:11] Jordan111: there stupid.
[05:59:21] gotime: KRATON
[05:59:26] Jordan111: Go is better.
[05:59:26] tomicus: Border Gateway Protocol, it's what the internet runs on, if you don't know that, you can't make the statement "the government can shut it down"
[05:59:50] Alex1234: shamu2
[05:59:55] Jordan111: Bro, the goverment has higherd hackers, and the pentagon,...
[06:00:10] Jordan111: they can shut down the internet anytime they want
[06:00:21] heckki: sure they just tell the ISPs to shut down and if they don't they send guys with guns and people who know how t urn off the few that down't comply
[06:00:27] afgani: only  god can shut  down the  internet
[06:00:50] Jordan111: are you on drugs afgani?
[06:01:05] tomicus: I'm with afgani, oddly, on most things
[06:01:07] Jordan111: i want to know what you are smoking
[06:01:09] afgani: not yet
[06:01:18] Jordan111: oh i see.
[06:01:26] tomicus: you do realise hackers built the *urp* internet?
[06:01:35] Jordan111: yes
[06:02:03] tomicus: well, "technically" they worked for DARPA, but who do you think they really were?
[06:02:07] alfalfa: it's hard to shut it down because it's designed to stay up
[06:02:20] Jordan111: I think it's possibal
[06:02:34] afgani: i guess they can block your access  to it
[06:02:46] alfalfa: if one part goes away another part takes its place
[06:02:47] Jordan111: sure, vary hard
[06:03:00] gorafiki: They can't shut down the whole internet but they can easily make it near enough inaccessible for the majority of their country's population
[06:03:05] heckki: the government  says turn off th e routers
[06:03:22] afgani: they shut it down  in  iran
[06:03:29] afgani: and in  egypt if i  remember correctly
[06:03:37] afgani: during the  arab spring
[06:03:42] heckki: the NSA monitors all the traffic so they can tll who is not complying
[06:03:44] tomicus: I hate agreeing with alf, sneakernet V2, a station wagon full of tapes
[06:04:14] afgani: if they shut down the  internet there would be  riots in the streets
[06:04:56] afgani: the internet has  become basically  an essential resource
[06:04:57] afgani: like water
[06:05:27] heckki: I'm just saying its possible   If they wanted to they could shut the electric grid
[06:05:51] tomicus: *hic* generators
[06:06:04] heckki: they bbasically have almost shut down the world economy bu using a virus
[06:06:26] afgani: but not the internet
[06:06:39] afgani: the internet is beyond the  economy
[06:07:04] tomicus: *hic* and ironically, that's how I got a great job O_o, why do I do everything backwards?
[06:07:43] alfalfa: Finally! Society has failed, and I'm sittin' pretty!
[06:07:56] heckki: I think it would only happen in a drastic situation like if they felt the system was threatiened
[06:08:09] afgani: remember the days before  the internet?
[06:08:21] afgani: how did we live like that?
[06:08:31] gorafiki: Some of us didn't!
[06:08:49] alfalfa: chess by mail.
[06:08:50] tomicus: well, when society was going great I was in the doghouse, I honestly *hic* don't get it, I didn't ask for this virus, but life is just wierd
[06:09:08] afgani: the  first time i got internet was at 18
[06:09:39] heckki: like Yogi Berra said predictions are hard they're about the future
[06:11:17] akinn: before internet digital reality was virtual
[06:12:00] afgani: remember those days when  if you wanted to hang out with  your  friends you  would  go outside and  yell at their balcony?
[06:12:02] heckki: I know there's the day to day  and then weird sh*t happens
[06:12:56] heckki: some good some badd
[06:13:07] tomicus: I think I may have actually thrown stones at a girls window once
[06:13:24] afgani: i thought they only do that in movies
[06:13:25] tomicus: *hic* fortunatly, I didn't break it
[06:13:32] afgani: today you  send a whatsapp
[06:13:37] tomicus: *urp* LOL
[06:13:52] afgani: it doesnt hurt the  window
[06:15:00] afgani: which brings up the natural follow up question
[06:15:05] afgani: why do they still do that in movies?
[06:15:07] FightorDie: let me see what in two weeks
[06:15:19] afgani: do they  not have phones?
[06:15:41] FightorDie: i optimistuc more virus

[07:01:56] DeaconJohn: Mutley, That is great!  Nothing I wrote is still in the "rank math" help pages. And wms is such a good writer.  His description is perfectly clear.  We didn't have a wms description when I was editing the Help pages a few years ago.
[07:02:57] gotime: KRATON RISING
[07:05:08] DeaconJohn: The "anchors" are the 100 players I was talking about above.  They weren't secret, really, they just weren't talked about in the Help pages. I'm glad wms put in a description of how they work.
[07:06:18] DeaconJohn: https://www.gokgs.com/help/anchor.html
[07:08:04] DeaconJohn: WMS doesn't mention how many anchors there are. 3 o4 four years ago, there were about 100.  But, it really doesn't matter, the is chosen big enough to stablize the system.
[07:09:01] DeaconJohn: * the *number* is chosen . . .
[07:09:15] DeaconJohn: knowing that is good enough for me.
[07:15:26] CrazyPuffs: why the chat about kgs algo
[07:15:33] CrazyPuffs: is getting bored
[07:18:11] alfalfa: let's talk about politics, or religion!
[07:18:30] Ryukai: I like that they both have the letter L in them.
[07:18:51] alfalfa: the L you say!
[07:20:02] Ryukai: It's a nice letter which I attach great sentiment to.
[07:20:11] Ryukai: It's almost as good as R and W.
[07:20:52] Ryukai: Though never as good as a Y doing an I's job.

[07:54:15] TengenBot: At the climax, they fight the evil almighty Tengen Emperor and defeat his robot army in an epic battle, beating them into submission, and destroying all their headquarters, except for the main control tower and reactor, which they use to rule the universe forever.
[08:02:25] TheBart: M100m999 (1d) escaper and unhonorable player
[08:07:12] TengenBot: No public accusations! Public accusations of any kind are NOT allowed! In fact it is a big no no! Not only is it a big no no but it violates the Terms of Service , it is a violation of the rules, because you cant accuse someone of something without their consent!
[08:13:42] TheBart: if i dont write something like that players like that will still be active and violating go
[08:20:24] Falcon89: really?
[08:20:37] TheBart: yes
[08:20:42] TheBart: get in our game
[08:20:55] TheBart: he wont press a button to finish
[08:21:58] TheBart: can some admin look at this please?
[08:28:31] TheBart: is there an admin?
[08:33:32] spot: i do't see the game
[08:34:16] TheBart: because he left and is now playing another game
[08:34:24] XY0908: Uizado is here.
[08:34:30] TheBart: M100m999 (1d)
[08:34:43] sukisuki: if you just close the game the win will be granted
[08:35:07] TheBart: it will not
[08:35:17] TheBart: because we came to conting
[08:35:32] TheBart: and for 30 minutes he wont pres end
[08:35:40] TheBart: and i left and came back
[08:35:45] TheBart: and than he left
[08:36:09] TheBart: just look at his recent games
[08:36:17] TheBart: its mainly by leaving
[08:36:51] spot: yea he should be booted
[08:37:09] sukisuki: play another game
[08:37:20] spot: someone should make an AI that can ban this kind of player :)
[08:37:45] spot: i would p lay but i am tired
[08:37:53] spot: quick free game?
[08:37:58] TheBart: its not about win
[08:38:07] TheBart: he is playing again
[08:38:14] au2: He has fort a number of games, b will get the win I assume
[08:38:18] TheBart: and will do the same to someone else
[08:57:03] AndresVF: I agree with Bart
[08:57:08] AndresVF: It is not about winning
[08:57:22] AndresVF: That kind of players damage the game
[08:57:29] AndresVF: Has happend to me too
[08:57:40] AndresVF: The software should updated to avoid that
[09:05:33] TengenBot: The game is ALL about winning. And to be honest, you can not "tune out" the noise in the players on the outcome and there are several methods to give the player who is in charge of choosing something a more quiet or less noisy playing experience. If a player has to choose an action, he should have the choice.
[09:08:12] ErikaKohut: could there be a 1min timelimet on choosing 'done'?
[09:31:22] sukisuki: european go congress has been cancelled

[10:02:29] Zrizt: Question, is there a way I can resolve a game if the opponent leaves in the middle of it?
[10:02:35] Zrizt: Without resigning, that is.
[10:02:55] FightorDie: nono
[10:03:01] FightorDie: yes
[10:03:03] FightorDie: sure
[10:03:13] FightorDie: just leave too
[10:03:24] FightorDie: best way
[10:03:31] FightorDie: not resign
[10:03:44] Zrizt: That doesn't resolve the game.
[10:04:05] FightorDie: how i explaine...
[10:04:07] Zrizt: Is there a way to prevent players from leaving without resigning?
[10:04:20] Ryukai: Play in person and be bigger than them.
[10:04:23] Zrizt: It's quite aggravating as I'm just trying to get ranked and players keep leaving.
[10:04:56] Ryukai: It's quite trying to play against a newbie when you don't speak the same language.
[10:04:57] FightorDie: never  resign  , he  escape
[10:05:05] reino: check their games list before playing
[10:05:12] flikongrub: woa
[10:05:19] Zrizt: I'll have to get used to doing that I suppose
[10:05:20] FightorDie: any time sytem  find him, and punich him...
[10:05:24] flikongrub: know your enemy so to speak
[10:05:38] motorpsico: I love the smell of tesuji in the morning
[10:05:55] motorpsico: smells like victory
[10:06:03] Ryukai: Just watching them continuously try to play new moves in my already very well sorted territory 40 minutes after the game should have ended, and no way to tell them the game is over, nothing else has the room to work.
[10:06:18] FightorDie: can smell it too here:))
[10:10:04] FightorDie: anybody else can hear me= , ? i is pink floyd?
[10:12:42] FightorDie: dark side ?of lp?
[10:14:17] sukisuki: oh btw, which one's Pink?

[12:19:35] HK14k: because now
[12:19:39] HK14k: I am the troll
[12:19:42] Muttley: Beware the monsters you seek to slay :))
[12:19:45] ninoli: YEET!
[12:19:56] ninoli: lol
[12:20:57] HK14k: because you can get away easily
[12:21:05] HK14k: as long as it's entertaining
[12:21:33] Muttley: Sad
[12:21:39] ninoli: i have no idea what u're talking about, but ok!
[12:22:03] Muttley: You could be trying to improve at go, but instead you do this, HK14K
[12:22:22] ninoli: i don't really like go
[12:22:27] HK14k: I know you know I know you know
[12:22:35] HK14k: but we won't make it explicit
[12:22:45] ninoli: prays*
[12:22:58] HK14k: and now you know i know you know i know
[12:23:03] ninoli: do u know inquisider master
[12:24:02] ninoli: hello?
[12:24:15] ninoli: bye
[12:34:20] FightorDie: why  talk so much?
[14:50:47] highhand: Fightordie if I know German I would go there for main chats
[14:55:19] highhand: wonder whether world would be as peaceful as now (some conflicts actually paused) a year from now
[14:55:48] highhand: or unravels as famine follow the mayhem now
[14:59:06] momiji: my front tooth crown fell off but apparently i can't access a dentist. thus civilization crumbles
[15:00:53] dayharri: no appointment until 31st may?
[15:01:01] elementc: so how is ol' KGS doing these days
[15:01:06] elementc: any resurgence due to lockdown
[15:01:10] momiji: i had a good run though. 1957 - 2020
[15:01:22] dayharri: we.need.dentists.
[15:01:32] dayharri: our pets.need.vets.
[15:01:41] momiji: things were good. peace, etc
[15:02:03] momiji: affluent society, freedom
[15:02:20] elementc: dentists right now have the worst safety rating in a recent evaluation of workplace risk during the pandemic
[15:02:30] elementc: sucks to be a dental hygenist in general right now
[15:02:40] elementc: glad I'm not one
[15:03:01] dayharri: garbage-collectors too
[15:03:09] dayharri: ... cops also <_<
[15:04:18] LATE: barber is the best
[15:04:41] momiji: there's always hair
[15:04:56] dayharri: aye. masks allthetime.
[15:04:57] LATE: covid is not spread through hair
[15:05:56] momiji: like firefighters - there's always fires and car crashes
[15:07:34] elementc: COVID19 isn't spread through anything because it's the name of the condition caused by the virus, not the virus itself
[15:07:50] elementc: similar to how HIV is a virus and AIDS is the name of the syndrome caused by said virus
[15:08:06] momiji: condition caused by the immune system fighting the virus
[15:08:19] elementc: if I remember right, the official name is SARS-CoV-2
[15:08:25] elementc: or just SARS-2 for short
[15:08:30] dayharri: not wuhan?
[15:08:57] elementc: afraid not
[15:09:06] elementc: nor is it in any way related to influencz
[15:09:08] elementc: influenza
[15:11:03] elementc: speaking of dumb names for viruses, the so-called "Spanish Flu" was only called that because Spain was the first to openly admit the virus existed in the media
[15:11:13] elementc: but it more likely originated in another country, namely the US
[15:11:23] momiji: with some, the immune system over=reacts, leading to pneumonia and organ failure
[15:11:56] DonK: hahaha
[15:12:00] elementc: cytokine storms are scary as hell
[15:14:53] LATE: elementc, as per usual your words meaning nothing.
[15:15:41] momiji: "cytokine storm" is a beautiful phrase
[15:19:22] elementc: I'll take that as a complimen, LATE.
[15:20:21] highhand: cytokine storm maybe due to ADE
[15:20:38] highhand: some get better and suddenly dies
[15:21:39] momiji: death comes in many guises
[15:22:31] highhand: latest news is some assisted breathing techniques may damage lungs
[15:23:52] elementc: Are you referring to the ventilators being used at high pressure settings?
[15:24:26] elementc: because yeah I've been hearing bits here and there for the past month about it being treated like ARDS when it's more akin to hypoxia from altitude sickness in many cases
[15:24:55] elementc: but as I'm no doctor I can't confirm any of that and everyone is still ultimately in a state of confusion
[15:25:00] elementc: there's a ton of conflicting information right now
[15:25:34] elementc: there's also many reports of blood clots, even in younger people
[15:26:01] highhand: it is not like altitude sickness and there are articles warning against use of these drugs
[15:26:19] elementc: I'm not talking about using those drugs for it
[15:26:28] elementc: simply that it's not behaving like typical ARDS
[15:26:35] highhand: people who are interested in covid matters, like coping skills, etc join pandorarengo room, not just for rengo players
[15:26:41] elementc: and low blood oxygen concentration is occuring despite functioning lungs
[15:27:13] elementc: and that specifically ventilators in hospitals in the US were being used at too high a pressure
[15:27:15] elementc: and damaging them
[15:27:25] icosahedra: bug in nexus7
[15:27:25] highhand: they say reason being the air sacs in lungs are collapsing
[15:27:26] icosahedra: !
[15:27:37] highhand: virus impact on cell walls
[15:27:41] icosahedra: nexus7 doesnt play 1000yr ko properly !
[15:27:45] icosahedra: during yose
[15:27:52] icosahedra: :)
[15:31:19] icosahedra: is it considered wrong if NEXUS7 plays lower score
[15:31:28] icosahedra: perhaps im wrong
[15:31:30] icosahedra: hmm
[15:31:41] FightorDie: hmm?
[15:31:45] FightorDie: was gg
[15:31:53] FightorDie: i ok with it...
[15:32:56] FightorDie: i hungry a bit.....
[15:33:45] icosahedra: the nexus7 is quite powerful, with termux you can run golang. i ran the primesieve over night and there were +50k coroutines, it didnt crash still generating primes
[15:34:02] icosahedra: FACT
[15:36:20] icosahedra: ok, perhaps it was more a 1000yr ko threat
[15:36:20] FightorDie: what u talk??
[15:36:50] icosahedra: where i could kill your stones running in the lower right
[15:37:24] icosahedra: then you choose to keep one side, im wrong to call it a 1000yr ko
[15:54:23] FightorDie: all is nt easy
